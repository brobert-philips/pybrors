AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of present study was to assess the association between acute 
      post-traumatic atrophy (APTMA) determined on psoas computed tomography [CT] scan 
      and the duration of mechanical ventilation and outcomes in severe trauma 
      patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of severe trauma patients (Injury 
      Severity Score [ISS], >15) hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) for more 
      than 7 days between January 2010 and December 2015 was performed. The psoas 
      muscle index (PMI) was measured on admission and at delayed CT scan. ΔPMI was 
      calculated as the percentage PMI loss between these two scans. Three groups were 
      defined and compared a posteriori using the quartiles of the ΔPMI values: low 
      (lower quartile), moderate, and severe (higher quartile) APTMA groups. Linear 
      regression analysis was performed to predict the duration of mechanical 
      ventilation, of catecholamines, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU and hospital, and 
      complications were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 114 trauma patients were 
      included (median age, 40 years; [IQR, 25-54 years]; ISS, 33 [IQR, 25-41]). Based 
      on the ΔPMI determination, 29 patients were allocated in the low APTMA group 
      (range ∆PMI, 0%-6%), 56 in the moderate APTMA group (range ∆PMI, 6%-18%), and 29 
      in the APTMA group (range ∆PMI, ≥19%). Severity of APTMA was significantly 
      associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation and catecholamines, ICU 
      and hospital LOS (P<0.001). Delayed pneumonia (P=0.006) and other delayed 
      infections (P=0.014), as well as thromboembolic events (P=0.04) were 
      statistically associated with the severity of APTMA, whereas mortality did not 
      differ between the three groups (P=0.20). Using linear regression analysis, each 
      ∆PMI increase of 1% was significantly associated with 0.90 supplementary days of 
      mechanical ventilation (P<0.001), 0.29 supplementary days of catecholamines 
      (P<0.001) and 0.82 supplementary days of hospitalization (P<0.001). All these 
      statistical associations were confirmed in multivariate analysis (P<0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Acute muscle atrophy diagnosed on CT scan by psoas area measurement 
      (ΔPMI) was strongly associated with poor outcomes in severe trauma patients.

TI  - Development and validation of a composite score to predict severe forms of 
      ischemic colitis.
PG  - 6355-6366
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08726-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple scoring system in order to predict the risk of 
      severe (death and/or surgery) ischemic colitis METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, 205 patients diagnosed with ischemic colitis in a tertiary hospital were 
      consecutively included over a 6-year period. The study sample was sequentially 
      divided into a training cohort (n = 103) and a validation cohort (n = 102). In 
      the training cohort, multivariable analysis was used to identify clinical, 
      biological, and CT variables associated with poor outcome and to build a risk 
      scoring system. The discriminative ability of the score (sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) was estimated 
      in the two cohorts to externally validate the score, and a receiver operating 
      characteristic curve was established to estimate the area under the curve of the 
      score. Bootstrapping was used to validate the score internally. RESULTS: In the 
      training cohort, four independent variables were associated with unfavorable 
      outcome: hemodynamic instability (2 pts), involvement of the small bowel (1 pt), 
      paper-thin wall pattern (3 pts), no stratified enhancement pattern (1 pt). The 
      score was used to categorize patients into low risk (score: 0, 1), high risk 
      (score: 2-3), and very high risk (score: 4-7) groups with sensitivity and 
      specificity of 97% and 67%, respectively, and a good discriminating capability, 
      with a C-statistic of 0.94. Internal and external validation showed good 
      discrimination capability (C-statistics of 0.9 and 0.84, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: A simple risk score can stratify patients into three distinct 
      prognosis groups, which can optimize patient management. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: 
      NCT04662268 KEY POINTS: • Simple scoring system predicting the risk of severe 
      ischemic colitis • First study to include CT findings to the clinical and 
      biological data used to determine a severity score.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to make a systematic review of clinical 
      studies evaluating software-based tumor margin assessment after percutaneous 
      thermoablation (PTA) of liver tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic 
      literature search was performed through Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane 
      Library. Original studies published in English that reported on software-based 
      assessment of ablation margins (AM) following PTA of liver tumors were selected. 
      Studies were analyzed with respect to design, number of patients and tumors, 
      tumor type, PTA technique, tumor size, target registration error, study 
      outcome(s) (subtypes: feasibility, comparative, clinical impact, predictive or 
      survival), and follow-up period. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles (one multi-center 
      and two prospective studies) were included. The majority were feasibility (26/29, 
      89.7%) or predictive (23/29, 79.3%) studies. AM was a risk factor of local tumor 
      progression (LTP) in 25 studies (25/29, 86.2%). In nine studies (9/29, 31%) 
      visual assessment overestimated AM compared with software-aided assessment. LTP 
      occurred at the location of the thinnest margin in nine studies (9/29, 31%). Time 
      for registration and analysis was heterogeneously reported, ranging between 5-30 
      min. Mean target registration error was reported in seven studies (7/29, 24.1%) 
      at 1.62 mm (range: 1.20-2.23 mm). Inter-operator reproducibility was high (kappa 
      range: 0.686-1). Ascites, liver deformation and inconspicuous tumor were major 
      factors of co-registration error. CONCLUSION: Available studies present a low 
      level of evidence overall, since most of them are feasibility, retrospective and 
      single-center studies.

TI  - O-RADS MRI Classification of Indeterminate Adnexal Lesions: Time-Intensity Curve 
      Analysis Is Better Than Visual Assessment.
PG  - 566-575
LID - 10.1148/radiol.210342 [doi]
AB  - Background The MRI Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) enables 
      risk stratification of sonographically indeterminate adnexal lesions, partly 
      based on time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis, which may not be universally 
      available. Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment with 
      that of TIC assessment of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans to categorize 
      adnexal lesions as benign or malignant and to evaluate the influence on the 
      O-RADS MRI score. Materials and Methods The European Adnex MR Study Group, or 
      EURAD, database, a prospective multicenter study of women undergoing MRI for 
      indeterminate adnexal lesions between March 2013 and March 2018, was queried 
      retrospectively. Women undergoing surgery for an adnexal lesion with solid tissue 
      were included. Solid tissue enhancement relative to outer myometrium was assessed 
      visually and with TIC. Contrast material washout was recorded. Lesions were 
      categorized according to the O-RADS MRI score with visual and TIC assessment. 
      Per-lesion diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Results A total of 320 lesions 
      (207 malignant, 113 benign) in 244 women (mean age, 55.3 years ± 15.8 [standard 
      deviation]) were analyzed. Sensitivity for malignancy was 96% (198 of 207) and 
      76% (157 of 207) for TIC and visual assessment, respectively. TIC was more 
      accurate than visual assessment (86% [95% CI: 81, 90] vs 78% [95% CI: 73, 82]; P 
      < .001) for benign lesions, predominantly because of higher specificity (95% [95% 
      CI: 92, 98] vs 76% [95% CI: 68, 81]). A total of 21% (38 of 177) of invasive 
      lesions were rated as low risk visually. Contrast material washout and high-risk 
      enhancement (defined as earlier enhancement than in the myometrium) were highly 
      specific for malignancy for both TIC (97% [95% CI: 91, 99] and 94% [95% CI: 90, 
      97], respectively) and visual assessment (97% [95% CI: 92, 99] and 93% [95% CI: 
      88, 97], respectively). O-RADS MRI score was more accurate with TIC than with 
      visual assessment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87 
      [95% CI: 0.83, 0.90] vs 0.73 [95% CI: 0.68, 0.78]; P < .001). Conclusion 
      Time-intensity curve analysis was more accurate than visual assessment for 
      achieving optimal diagnostic accuracy with the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data 
      System MRI score. Clinical trial registration no. NCT01738789 © RSNA, 2022 Online

TI  - Prediction of clinical response to corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma 
      injection in plantar fasciitis with MRI: A prospective, randomized, 
      double-blinded study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify association between magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) features and clinical data at baseline and six months 
      following platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or corticosteroid (CS; cortivazol) injection 
      in patients with plantar fasciitis, and to identify initial MRI criteria 
      associated with a favorable clinical response to treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03857334). MRI examinations of 
      36 patients with plantar fasciitis lasting more than 3 months who were randomly 
      assigned to receive ultrasound-guided PRP (PRP group, 20 patients) or CS (CS 
      group, 18 patients) injection were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed with 
      respect to plantar fascia thickness, plantar fascia hyperintensity on T2-weighted 
      STIR (HSTIR) images, calcaneal bone marrow and surrounding soft tissues. Clinical 
      evaluation including visual analytic scale (VAS) assessment and MRI examinations 
      were obtained before and 6 months after treatment. Good clinical response was 
      defined as pain VAS decrease > 50% at 6 months. ROC curves with AUC measurements 
      were used to determine cut-off points. RESULTS: In the whole study population, an 
      association was found between MRI features (deep soft tissue and calcaneal bone 
      marrow HSTIR) and pain VAS scores for the first steps of the day (P = 0.028 and 
      P = 0.007, respectively). No significant radioclinical associations on 
      post-treatment MRI examinations were found in either group. Initial coronal 
      thickness of plantar fascia was associated with a good clinical response in the 
      CS group (P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis found that 7-mm or thicker plantar 
      aponeurosis at initial MRI was predictive of good clinical response in patients 
      with CS treatment (Youden index = 0.6). PRP infiltrations were effective 
      regardless of fascia thickness (73% of patients with ≤ 7 mm aponeurosis and 67% 
      for thicker ones). CONCLUSION: Initial facia thickness (> 7 mm) is predictive of 
      good clinical response six months after CS injection, whereas PRP injection shows 
      effectiveness regardless of fascia thickness.

TI  - Reader performances in breast lesion characterization via DBT: One or two views 
      and which view?

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the performance in breast lesion characterization of one-view 
      mediolateral (MLO) digital mammography plus digital breast tomosynthesis (DM-DBT) 
      versus one-view craniocaudal (CC) DM-DBT versus two-view DM-DBT. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study 
      conducted on 138 women from the population of a previous prospective multicenter 
      study, with 69 consecutive patients with benign or high-risk lesions and 69 
      randomized patients with breast cancer, all confirmed at pathology. Four 
      radiologists (two senior and two junior) blinded to the clinical, mammographic 
      and pathological data independently reviewed the MLO DM-DBT views, the CC DM-DBT 
      views and the MLO + CC DM-DBT views using the American College of Radiology 
      Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System criteria for index lesion 
      characterization. Areas under the receiver were calculated and compared for each 
      reader and imaging protocol. RESULTS: No significant differences in breast cancer 
      characterization were observed between single MLO and CC views for all the 
      readers. The added value of a second view was statistically significant for 
      characterization in pooled data and for junior readers but not for senior readers 
      (p ranging from 0.15 to 0.57 depending on the view and the senior reader). 
      Finally, in 4 breast cancer cases, lesions were only detectable on the CC DM-DBT 
      view in two cases and on the MLO DM-DBT view in the two other cases. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results support the use of two-view DM-DBT for breast lesion characterization 
      when the readers are inexperienced. There is no significant difference between CC 
      and MLO views when diagnosis is performed with one view.

TI  - No Association of Early-Onset Breast or Ovarian Cancer with Early-Onset Cancer in 
      Relatives in BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation Families.

AB  - According to clinical guidelines, the occurrence of very early-onset breast 
      cancer (VEO-BC) (diagnosed ≤ age 30 years) or VEO ovarian cancer (VEO-OC) 
      (diagnosed ≤ age 40 years) in families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAm) 
      prompts advancing the age of risk-reducing strategies in relatives. This study 
      aimed to assess the relation between the occurrence of VEO-BC or VEO-OC in 
      families with BRCAm and age at BC or OC diagnosis in relatives. We conducted a 
      retrospective multicenter study of 448 consecutive families with BRCAm from 2003 
      to 2018. Mean age and 5-year-span distribution of age at BC or OC in relatives 
      were compared in families with or without VEO-BC or VEO-OC. Conditional 
      probability calculation and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests were used to 
      investigate early-onset cancer occurrence in relatives of VEO-BC and VEO-OC 
      cases. Overall, 15% (19/245) of families with BRCA1m and 9% (19/203) with BRCA2m 
      featured at least one case of VEO-BC; 8% (37/245) and 2% (2/203) featured at 
      least one case of VEO-OC, respectively. The cumulative prevalence of VEO-BC was 
      5.1% (95% CI 3.6-6.6) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.4-3.6) for families with BRCA1m and 
      BRCA2m, respectively. The distribution of age and mean age at BC diagnosis in 
      relatives did not differ by occurrence of VEO-BC for families with BRCA1m or 
      BRCA2m. Conditional probability calculations did not show an increase of 
      early-onset BC in VEO-BC families with BRCA1m or BRCA2m. Conversely, the 
      probability of VEO-BC was not increased in families with early-onset BC. VEO-BC 
      or VEO-OC occurrence may not be related to young age at BC or OC onset in 
      relatives in families with BRCAm. This finding-together with a relatively high 
      VEO-BC risk for women with BRCAm-advocates for MRI breast screening from age 25 
      regardless of family history.

TI  - O-RADS MRI score: analysis of misclassified cases in a prospective multicentric 
      European cohort.
PG  - 9588-9599

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively review the causes of categorization errors using 
      O-RADS-MRI score and to determine the presumptive causes of these 
      misclassifications. METHODS: EURAD database was retrospectively queried to 
      identify misclassified lesions. In this cohort, 1194 evaluable patients with 1502 
      pelvic masses (277 malignant / 1225 benign lesions) underwent standardized MRI to 
      characterize adnexal masses with histology or 2 years' follow-up as a reference 
      standard. An expert radiologist reviewed cases with two junior radiologists and 
      lesions termed misclassified if malignant lesion was scored ≤ 3, a benign lesion 
      was scored ≥ 4, the site of origin was incorrect, or a non-adnexal mass was 
      incorrectly categorized as benign or malignant. RESULTS: There were 139 / 1502 
      (9.2%) misclassified masses in 116 women including 109 adnexal and 30 non-adnexal 
      masses. False-negative cases corresponded to 16 borderline or invasive malignant 
      adnexal masses rated score ≤ 3 (16 / 139, 11.5%). False-positive cases 
      corresponded to 88 benign masses were rated score 4 (67 / 139, 48.2%) or 5 (18 / 
      139,12.9%) or considered suspicious non-adnexal lesions (3 / 139, 2.2%). 
      Misclassifications were only due to origin error in 12 adnexal masses (8 benign, 
      4 malignant) (8.6%, 12 / 139) and 23 non-adnexal masses (18 benign, 5 
      malignant,16.5%, 23 / 139) perceived respectively as non-adnexal and adnexal 
      masses. Interpretive error (n = 104), failure to recognize technical insufficient 
      exams (n = 9), and perceptual errors (n = 4) were found. Most interpretive was 
      due to misinterpretation of solid tissue or incorrect assignment of mass origin. 
      Eighty-four out of 139 cases were correctly reclassified by the readers with 
      strict adherence to the score rules. CONCLUSION: Most errors were due to 
      misinterpretation of solid tissue or incorrect assignment of mass origin. KEY 
      POINTS: • Prospective assignment of O-RADS-MRI score resulted in 
      misclassification of 9.25% of sonographically indeterminate pelvic masses. • Most 
      errors were interpretive (74.8%) due to misinterpretation of solid tissue as 
      defined by the lexicon or incorrect assignment of mass origin. • Pelvic 
      inflammatory disease is a common source of misclassification (8.9%) (12 / 139).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess CT signs to discriminate an appendiceal tumor versus a 
      non-tumoral appendix in an acute appendicitis context. METHODS: A 10-year 
      bicentric retrospective case-control study was performed in adults. Patients with 
      a histopathological appendiceal tumor and appendicitis were paired for age and 
      sex with patients with non-tumorous appendicitis (1/3 ratio, respectively). Two 
      senior radiologists blindly analyzed numerous CT findings with final consensus to 
      perform univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. A diagnostic CT scan 
      score was calculated with a bootstrap internal validation. Reproducibility was 
      assessed based on the kappa statistic. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients (51 +/- 
      21 years; 114 males) were included (52 patients in the tumor group and 156 in the 
      non-tumor group). In the multivariate analysis, an appendicolith and fat 
      stranding were protective factors with OR = 0.2 (p = 0.01) and OR = 0.3 
      (p = 0.02), respectively, while mural calcifications (OR = 47, p = 0.0001), an 
      appendix mass (OR = 7.1, p = 0.008), a focal asymmetric wall abnormality 
      (OR = 4.9, p = 0, 001), or a ≥ 15 mm diameter (OR = 3.5, p = 0.009) were positive 
      predictive factors of an underlying tumor. Using a ≥1 cut-off, our diagnostic 
      score had an AUC = 0.87 (95 % CI, 0.82-0.93) and a positive likelihood 
      ratio = 13.5 (95 % CI, 6.7-27.1). CONCLUSION: We developed a reliable scoring 
      system based on CT findings, which is highly predictive of an underlying 
      appendiceal neoplasm in an appendicitis context using a ≥1 cut-off.

TI  - Imaging strategies for patients with suspicion of uncomplicated colic pain: 
      diagnostic accuracy and management assessment.
PG  - 2983-2993
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-07264-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare different imaging scenarios in the diagnosis of uncomplicated 
      renal colic due to urolithiasis (URCU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 206 
      prospectively included patients had been admitted with suspected URCU and had 
      undergone abdominal plain film (APF), US and unenhanced CT after clinical STONE 
      score evaluation. CT was the reference standard. We assessed sensitivity (Se), 
      specificity (Spe) and Youden index for colic pain diagnosis, percentage of 
      patients managed by urologic treatment with stone identified, percentage of 
      alternative diagnoses (AD) and exposure to radiation, according to single imaging 
      approaches, strategies driven by patient characteristics and conditional imaging 
      strategies after APF and US. RESULTS: One hundred (48.5%) patients had a final 
      diagnosis of URCU and 19 underwent urologic treatment. The conditional strategy, 
      i.e. CT in patients who had no stone identified at US, had a perfect sensitivity 
      and specificity. This enabled diagnosis of all stones requiring urology 
      management while decreasing the number of CT exams by 22%. The strategy whereby 
      CT was used when there was neither direct or indirect APF + US finding of colic 
      pain nor alternative diagnoses in patients with a STONE score ≥ 10 had a 
      sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.99, identified 84% of stones managed 
      by urologic treatment and decreased the number of CT examinations by 76%. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with clinical findings consistent with URCU, the use of 
      ultrasound as first-line imaging modality, with CT restricted to patients with 
      negative US and a STONE score ≥ 10, led to a sensitivity and specificity of above 
      95%, identified 84% of stones requiring urological management and reduced the 
      number of CT scans needed by fourfold. KEY POINTS: • For diagnosis, the use of 
      APF + US as first-line imaging, with CT restricted to patients with both a normal 
      APF + US and a STONE score ≥ 10, provides both a sensitivity and specificity 
      superior or equal to 95% and reduces the number of CT scans necessary by 
      fourfold. • For management, the use of APF + US as first-line imaging, with CT 
      restricted to patients with both a normal APF + US and a STONE score ≥ 10, 
      maintains a 84% stone identification rate in urology-treated patients.

AB  - Large bowel obstruction (LBO) is associated with high morbidity and mortality due 
      to delayed diagnosis and/or treatment. MDCT has become the standard of care to 
      identify the site, severity, and etiology of obstruction. The goal of this review 
      is fourfold. The first objective is to give clues to differentiate LBO from 
      colonic pseudo-obstruction. The second objective is to describe CT features in 
      the most common cause of LBO which is colonic cancer by illustrating classical 
      and atypical features of colonic cancer responsible for LBO and by giving the 
      features which must be reported when differentiating malignant from benign: 
      presence of local lymph nodes, other colic localizations, length of involved 
      segment, presence of diverticula, or other. The third objective is to illustrate 
      the various causes of LBO which can mimic a colon cancer by leading to a 
      thickening of the colonic wall: diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, endometriosis, 
      inflammatory disease and to give tips which permit to evoke another diagnosis 
      than a colon cancer in patient with a LBO and a thickening of the colic wall. The 
      fourth objective is to describe the common signs of cecal and sigmoid volvulus 
      and to give tips for a diagnosis sometimes difficult particularly for cecal 
      volvulus: one of two transition points according to the type of volvulus and the 
      presence of a whirl sign with a torsion of the mesenteric vessels.

TI  - The Plasmatic Aldosterone and C-Reactive Protein Levels, and the Severity of 
      Covid-19: The Dyhor-19 Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9072315 [doi]
LID - 2315
AB  - BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the Covid-19 
      pandemic, uses the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), a physiological 
      inhibitor of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), as a cellular 
      receptor to infect cells. Since the RAAS can induce and modulate pro-inflammatory 
      responses, it could play a key role in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Thus, we 
      aimed to determine the levels of plasma renin and aldosterone as indicators of 
      RAAS activation in a series of consecutively admitted patients for Covid-19 in 
      our clinic. METHODS: Plasma renin and aldosterone levels were measured, among the 
      miscellaneous investigations needed for Covid-19 management, early after 
      admission in our clinic. Disease severity was assessed using a seven-category 
      ordinal scale. Primary outcome of interest was the severity of patients' clinical 
      courses. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. At inclusion, 12 patients 
      had mild clinical status, 25 moderate clinical status and 7 severe clinical 
      status. In univariate analyses, aldosterone and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels 
      at inclusion were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical course as 
      compared to those with mild or moderate course (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, 
      respectively). In multivariate analyses, only aldosterone and CRP levels remained 
      positively associated with severity. We also observed a positive significant 
      correlation between aldosterone and CRP levels among patients with an aldosterone 
      level greater than 102.5 pmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Both plasmatic aldosterone and CRP 
      levels at inclusion are associated with the clinical course of Covid-19. Our 
      findings may open new perspectives in the understanding of the possible role of 
      RAAS for Covid-19 outcome.

      Management.
PG  - 480-492

AB  - Adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) remains one of the leading causes of 
      emergency room visits and is still associated with high morbidity and mortality 
      rates. Because the management of adhesive SBO has shifted from immediate surgery 
      to nonoperative treatment in the absence of ischemia, it is crucial to rapidly 
      detect or predict strangulation, which requires emergent surgery. CT is now 
      established as the best imaging technique for the initial assessment of patients 
      suspected of having adhesive SBO. CT helps confirm the diagnosis of mechanical 
      SBO, locate the site of obstruction, establish the cause, and detect 
      complications. This article is a review of the role of imaging in answering 
      specific questions to help predict the management needs of each individual 
      patient. It includes (a) an update on the best CT signs for predicting ischemia 
      and a need for bowel resection; (b) a discussion of the CT features that help 
      differentiate open-loop from closed-loop obstruction and a single adhesive band 
      from matted adhesions and how these differences can influence the management; and 
      (c) a review of the main CT predictors of the success or failure of nonoperative 
      management in adhesive SBO.

AB  - Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies worldwide. Over 
      the past 30 years, imaging has become central to the diagnosis of appendicitis, 
      reducing both negative appendicectomy rate and healthcare expenses. Appendicitis 
      can be challenging in many ways for radiologists with various clinical 
      presentations, complications and differential diagnoses. The aim of this review 
      is to present a step-by-step reasoning with key findings, tips and tricks leading 
      to the diagnosis of appendicitis and its complications. The first steps are with 
      the use of the appropriate imaging modality (US, CT and MRI) to locate the 
      appendix in abdominal cavity and to identify the features of appendicitis and its 
      complications through specific imaging signs. The next steps are to eliminate an 
      unusual morphology of the appendix that may simulate acute appendicitis and to 
      recognize an unusual imaging presentation of appendicitis. Then, to corroborate 
      the diagnosis of appendicitis, the last step is to rule out any differential 
      diagnoses mainly from the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Following 
      these steps can help to accurately diagnose appendicitis and its complications.

TI  - MRI of sacroiliac joints for the diagnosis of axial SpA: prevalence of 
      inflammatory and structural lesions in nulliparous, early postpartum and late 
      postpartum women.
PG  - 1063-1069
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217208 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of bone marrow oedema (BME) at the 
      sacroiliac joint (SIJ) in early postpartum (EPP), nulliparous (NP) and late 
      postpartum (LPP) women, and to identify factors associated with BME presence at 
      the SIJ. METHODS: Three groups were obtained: NP (never given birth), EPP (given 
      birth within 12 months) and LPP (given birth more than 24 months). The primary 
      outcome was the presence of BME and/or structural lesions (erosions, osteophytes, 
      ankylosis and sclerosis) at the SIJ MRI. RESULTS: BME prevalence was greater 
      among EPP (33%) than NP (14%, p=0.001), but was not different to LPP (21%, 
      p=0.071). The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) MRI 
      criteria for sacroiliitis were positive in 75%, 71% and 80%, respectively, of 
      EPP, NP and LPP women with BME. EPP (38%) had similar prevalence of sclerosis 
      than LPP (28%, p=0.135), but greater than NP (18%, p=0.001). Lastly, EPP (28%) 
      had similar prevalence of osteophytes than LPP (42%) and NP (27%), although there 
      was a difference between LPP and NP (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: EPP have higher BME 
      prevalence at the SIJ than NP, EPP tend to have higher BME prevalence compared 
      with LPP and BME presence decreases with time from delivery. Three-quarters of 
      women with BME at the SIJ had a positive ASAS MRI criteria for sacroiliitis, 
      indicating that BME presence as the main criterion for a positive diagnosis can 
      lead to false-positive results. SIJ MRIs should not be interpreted in isolation, 
      since age, time from delivery and other factors may outweigh the pertinence of 
      MRI findings. Trial registration number NCT02956824.

AB  - Hyperandrogenism is frequent and under investigated in adolescent girls. A 
      15-year-6-month-old French girl presented with oligomenorrhea and slowly 
      progressing virilization 2 years post-menarche. Medical history revealed prenatal 
      pesticide exposure through maternal professional activity and recurrent premature 
      thelarche. Severe hirsutism, mild facial acne and clitoromegaly were noted. Serum 
      androgens (testosterone: 94 ng/dL, 4-androstenedione: 8.23 ng/mL) were high and 
      non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency was excluded. Pelvic ultrasonography showed 
      a left ovarian mass, confirmed by computed tomography scan. Tumor markers were 
      negative. Laparoscopic surgery was performed. The pathological diagnosis was 
      benign luteinized thecoma. Postoperatively, the menstrual cycle and serum 
      androgens became normal and hirsutism slowly improved. Hyperandrogenism 2 years 
      after menarche should be systematically investigated, even if slowly progressive, 
      since it may be a symptom of a rare virilizing ovarian tumor, like thecoma.

      Score for Risk Stratification of Sonographically Indeterminate Adnexal Masses.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Approximately one-quarter of adnexal masses detected at 
      ultrasonography are indeterminate for benignity or malignancy, posing a 
      substantial clinical dilemma. OBJECTIVE: To validate the accuracy of a 5-point 
      Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting Data System Magnetic Resonance Imaging (O-RADS MRI) 
      score for risk stratification of adnexal masses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted between March 1, 2013, 
      and March 31, 2016. Among patients undergoing expectant management, 2-year 
      follow-up data were completed by March 31, 2018. A routine pelvic MRI was 
      performed among consecutive patients referred to characterize a sonographically 
      indeterminate adnexal mass according to routine diagnostic practice at 15 
      referral centers. The MRI score was prospectively applied by 2 onsite readers and 
      by 1 reader masked to clinical and ultrasonographic data. Data analysis was 
      conducted between April and November 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary end point was the joint analysis of true-negative and false-negative 
      rates according to the MRI score compared with the reference standard (ie, 
      histology or 2-year follow-up). RESULTS: A total of 1340 women (mean [range] age, 
      49 [18-96] years) were enrolled. Of 1194 evaluable women, 1130 (94.6%) had a 
      pelvic mass on MRI with a reference standard (surgery, 768 [67.9%]; 2-year 
      follow-up, 362 [32.1%]). A total of 203 patients (18.0%) had at least 1 malignant 
      adnexal or nonadnexal pelvic mass. No invasive cancer was assigned a score of 2. 
      Positive likelihood ratios were 0.01 for score 2, 0.27 for score 3, 4.42 for 
      score 4, and 38.81 for score 5. Area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve was 0.961 (95% CI, 0.948-0.971) among experienced readers, with a 
      sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96; 189 of 203 patients) and a specificity of 
      0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93; 848 of 927 patients). There was good interrater 
      agreement among both experienced and junior readers (κ = 0.784; 95% CI, 
      0.743-0824). Of 580 of 1130 women (51.3%) with a mass on MRI and no specific 
      gynecological symptoms, 362 (62.4%) underwent surgery. Of them, 244 (67.4%) had 
      benign lesions and a score of 3 or less. The MRI score correctly reclassified the 
      mass origin as nonadnexal with a sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99; 1360 of 
      1372 patients) and a specificity of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.85; 102 of 130 
      patients). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the O-RADS MRI score was 
      accurate when stratifying the risk of malignancy in adnexal masses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Fast breast MRI protocols have the same sensitivity as conventional 
      protocols, but their specificity is variable and can be inadequate. An ultrafast 
      sequence provides early enhancement of lesion characteristics that optimize the 
      characterization of the fast protocol, increasing positive predictive values 
      without increasing time. CONCLUSION. These new abbreviated protocols could 
      constitute a viable screening tool both for women at high risk of breast cancer 
      and for those at intermediate risk with high breast density.

TI  - A simple CT score to quantify pelvic and retroperitoneal hematoma associated with 
      pelvic fractures predicts transfusion needs, pelvic hemostatic procedures, and 
      outcome.
PG  - 173-184

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic and retroperitoneal hematoma (PRH) in case of pelvic fracture 
      may lead to early hemorrhagic shock. Quantifying PRH remains challenging in 
      clinical practice. The goal of this study was to determine the statistical 
      association between a semi-quantitative scoring system for PRH assessed with 
      computed tomography (CT) and transfusion needs, pelvic hemostatic procedures, and 
      outcome. METHODS: All consecutive severe trauma patients with pelvic ring 
      fracture between 2010 and 2015 were included in this retrospective study. PRH was 
      quantified using semi-quantitative analysis on admission CT scan. The pelvis and 
      retroperitoneal cavity was assessed as 10 compartments. Hematoma was counted as 0 
      (absent), 1 (minimal or moderate), and 2 (large or bilateral) for each 
      compartment (maximum score of 20). The patients were divided into the following 3 
      groups: no or minimal PRH (score 0-5), moderate PRH (6-9), and large PRH (10-20). 
      These groups were compared in terms of initial transfusion needs, massive 
      transfusion, hemostatic procedures, and outcome. Logistic regression and receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 
      311 patients with pelvic fracture (mean age 41.9, [SD] 19.9 years; mean ISS 27.4, 
      [SD] 19.4; unstable fractures, 32%; ≥5 units of packed red blood cells, 37%; 
      massive transfusion, 19%; multiple organ failure, 29%; mortality, 13%), divided 
      into no or minimal PRH group (128 (22%)), moderate PRH group (115 (37%)), and 
      large PRH group (68 (22%)). Increasing PRH was found to increase transfusion 
      needs and massive transfusions, with a higher number of pelvic hemostatic 
      procedures, multiple organ failures, increasing need for mechanical ventilation, 
      and prolonged hospitalization; mortality was also increased. These significant 
      statistical associations were confirmed by logistic regression models (odds 
      ratio, 1.2-12.1 for moderate PRH, 3.1-30.2 for large PRH) and ROC curve analysis 
      (area under the ROC curve, 0.59-0.76). CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative assessment 
      of PRH on admission CT scan allows to predict transfusion needs, hemostatic 
      procedures, and worse outcome of severe trauma patients with pelvic fracture.

TI  - CT diagnosis of closed loop bowel obstruction mechanism is not sufficient to 
      indicate emergent surgery.
PG  - 1105-1112
LID - 10.1007/s00330-019-06413-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify computed tomography (CT) findings associated with successful 
      conservative treatment of closed loop small bowel obstruction (CL-SBO) due to 
      adhesions or internal herniation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The local institutional 
      review board approved this study while waiving informed consent. Clinical and CT 
      data were collected retrospectively for 96 consecutive patients with a CT 
      diagnosis of CL-SBO due to adhesions or internal herniation established by 
      experienced radiologists who had no role in patient management. Mechanical 
      obstruction with at least two transition zones on the bowel at a single site 
      defined CL-SBO. Two radiologists blinded to patient data independently performed 
      a retrospective review of the CT scans. The patient groups with successful versus 
      failed initial conservative therapy were compared. Univariate and multivariate 
      analyses were performed to look for CT findings associated with successful 
      conservative therapy. Interobserver agreement was assessed for each CT finding. 
      RESULTS: Of the 96 patients, 34 (35%) underwent immediate surgery and 62 (65%) 
      received first-line conservative treatment, which succeeded in 19 (31%) and 
      failed in 43 (69%). The distance between the transition zones was the only 
      independent predictor of successful conservative therapy (odds ratio, 4.6 when 
      ≥ 8 mm; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-18.3). A distance ≥ 8 mm had 84% 
      (95% CI, 60-97) sensitivity and 46% (95% CI, 31-62) specificity for successful 
      conservative treatment. The correlation coefficient for the distance between 
      transition zones between readers 1 and 2 was fair (r = 0.46). CONCLUSION: CL-SBO 
      can be resolved without surgery. When there is no CT sign of ischemia, the 
      distance between the transition zones should be assessed. KEY POINTS: • Twenty 
      percent (19/96) of all cases of closed loop small bowel obstruction (CL-SBO) 
      representing 31% of the patients given first-line conservative therapy, were 
      resolved without surgery. • The distance between the transition zones may help to 
      choose between conservative and surgical management in patients with a CL-SBO but 
      no CT evidence of ischemia. • A distance < 8 mm between the transition zones 
      suggests a need for emergent surgery.

AB  - The objective of this article was to evaluate the evidence currently available 
      about the clinical value of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast imaging. Nine 
      experts from the disciplines involved in breast disease management - including 
      physicists and radiologists - convened a meeting on June 3, 2019 to discuss the 
      evidence for the use of this technology in plenary and focused sessions. Prior to 
      the meeting, the group performed a literature review on predefined topics. This 
      paper presents the consensus reached by this working group on recommendations for 
      the future use of AI in breast screening and related research topics.

AB  - Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a new imaging technology that addresses the 
      limitation caused by overlapping structures in conventional two-dimensional 
      digital mammography owing to the acquisition of a series of low-dose projection 
      images. This unique technique provides a dual benefit to patients screened for 
      breast cancer. First, DBT increases the cancer detection rate mostly by 
      highlighting architectural distortions and allowing better assessment of masses 
      shape and margins. Second, DBT helps reduce recall rate by discarding asymmetries 
      related to overlapping tissue. However, DBT is not included in the majority of 
      cancer screening programs worldwide. Several issues still need to be addressed 
      such as over-diagnosis and over-treatment, lack of reduction of interval breast 
      cancer, quality control and storage, and radiation dose. In the diagnostic 
      setting, DBT increases the diagnostic accuracy and reduces the number of 
      indeterminate lesions in symptomatic women. Its aforementioned performances 
      regarding asymmetries, masses and architectural distortions allow reducing the 
      number of additional views while working-up a screening-detected lesion. Tumor 
      size is also better assessed at DBT as well as multicentricity, two significant 
      benefits in the staging of breast cancer. Finally, DBT allows a better analysis 
      of scars and helps reduce the rate of indeterminate findings after surgery. 
      Although somewhat limited by high breast density, DBT globally outperforms 
      digital mammography in both screening and diagnostic breast imaging. Additional 
      research is however needed, particularly on relevant screening outcomes. This 
      review describes the main performances of breast DBT in breast cancer screening 
      and diagnosis and the resulting consequences in both settings.

TI  - Immediate Hypersensitivity to Contrast Agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI Study.
PG  - 51-61
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2018.07.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast media (ICM; GBCM) induce 
      immediate hypersensitivity (IH) reactions. Differentiating allergic from 
      non-allergic IH is crucial; allergy contraindicates the culprit agent for life. 
      We studied frequency of allergic IH among ICM or GBCM reactors. METHODS: Patients 
      were recruited in 31 hospitals between 2005 and 2009. Clinical symptoms, plasma 
      histamine and tryptase concentrations and skin tests were recorded. Allergic IH 
      was diagnosed by intradermal tests (IDT) with the culprit CM diluted 1:10, 
      "potentially allergic" IH by positive IDT with pure CM, and non-allergic IH by 
      negative IDT. FINDINGS: Among 245 skin-tested patients (ICM = 209; GBCM = 36), 
      allergic IH to ICM was identified in 41 (19.6%) and to GBCM in 10 (27.8%). Skin 
      cross-reactivity was observed in 11 patients with ICM (26.8%) and 5 with GBCM 
      (50%). Allergy frequency increased with clinical severity and histamine and 
      tryptase concentrations (p < 0.0001). Cardiovascular signs were strongly 
      associated with allergy. Non-allergic IH was observed in 152 patients (62%) 
      (ICM:134; GBCM:18). Severity grade was lower (p < 0.0001) and reaction delay 
      longer (11.6 vs 5.6 min; p < 0.001). Potentially allergic IH was diagnosed in 42 
      patients (17.1%) (ICM:34; GBCM:8). The delay, severity grade, and mediator 
      release were intermediate between the two other groups. INTERPRETATION: Allergic 
      IH accounted for < 10% of cutaneous reactions, and > 50% of life-threatening 
      ones. GBCM and ICM triggered comparable IH reactions in frequency and severity. 
      Cross-reactivity was frequent, especially for GBCM. We propose considering skin 
      testing with pure contrast agent, as it is more sensitive than the usual 1:10 
      dilution criteria.

TI  - Local Tumor Staging of Breast Cancer: Digital Mammography versus Digital 
      Mammography Plus Tomosynthesis.
PG  - 594-603
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2019182457 [doi]
AB  - Background Combined digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis 
      (DBT) (hereafter, DM plus DBT) has increased cancer detection rates when compared 
      with those achieved with DM-only screening. However, there is limited literature 
      on DBT as an adjunct to mammography in the staging of known breast cancers. 
      Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of DM alone with that of DM plus DBT 
      in the identification of additional ipsilateral and contralateral lesions in 
      women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Materials and Methods This prospective 
      study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01881880) included 166 women with breast 
      cancer (mean age, 59.5 years ± 11; age range, 40-87 years) and used the 
      aforementioned techniques, with breast MRI and pathologic verification of all 
      suspected lesions as the reference standards. Four radiologists independently 
      reviewed the DM and DM plus DBT images using the American College of Radiology 
      Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems criteria for diagnosis of index lesions 
      and presence of additional disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained for DM and DM plus DBT 
      were compared by using the McNemar test. Results Twenty-four women (14%) 
      exhibited multifocal lesions; 20 (12%), multicentric lesions; 39 (23%), 
      additional ipsilateral lesions; and 18 (11%), bilateral lesions. The 
      sensitivities were higher for DM plus DBT than for DM in the diagnosis of 
      multicentric (51% [41 of 80] vs 37% [30 of 80], P = .002) and additional 
      ipsilateral (52% [81 of 156] vs 44% [69 of 156], P = .007) lesions. The AUC was 
      larger for DM plus DBT than for DM (0.74 vs 0.67, P = .02) in the diagnosis of 
      bilateral breast cancer. No significant differences in specificity were noted. 
      The added diagnostic value of DBT was limited to the group of women with nondense 
      breasts: For diagnosis of ipsilateral lesions, AUC of DM plus DBT versus DM was 
      0.74 versus 0.70 (P = .04). For diagnosis of contralateral lesions, AUC of DM 
      plus DBT verus DM was 0.76 versus 0.68 (P = .02). Conclusion The combination of 
      digital mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis improves diagnostic 
      accuracy for additional ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer in women with 
      nondense breasts. © RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Moy in this issue.

TI  - Pravastatin Reverses Established Radiation-Induced Cutaneous and Subcutaneous 
      Fibrosis in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: Results of the Biology-Driven 
      Phase 2 Clinical Trial Pravacur.
PG  - 365-373

AB  - PURPOSE: The "PRAVACUR" phase 2 trial (NCT01268202) assessed the efficacy of 
      pravastatin as an antifibrotic agent in patients with established cutaneous and 
      subcutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) after head and neck squamous cell 
      carcinoma (HNSCC) radiation therapy and/or radiochemotherapy. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: The main inclusion criteria were: NSCC in remission, grade ≥2 
      cutaneous and subcutaneous neck RIF (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
      Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0), and no current treatment with statins 
      or fibrates. Patients received pravastatin 40 mg/d for 12 months. The primary 
      endpoint was reduction of RIF thickness by more than 30% at 12 months, as 
      measured by cutaneous high-frequency ultrasonography. Secondary endpoints 
      included RIF severity reduction, pravastatin tolerance, and quality of life. 
      RESULTS: Sixty patients with grade 2 (n = 37), grade 3 (n = 22), or grade 4 
      (n = 1) RIF were enrolled from February 2011 to April 2016. The mean interval 
      between RIF diagnosis and pravastatin initiation was 17.1 months. Pravastatin was 
      stopped before 11 months of treatment in 18 patients (because of grade ≥2 adverse 
      events related to pravastatin in 8 patients [13%]). In the 40 patients in whom 
      pravastatin efficacy was assessed by high-frequency ultrasonography at baseline 
      and at 12 months of treatment, a reduction of RIF thickness ≥30% was observed in 
      15 of 42 patients (35.7%; 95% confidence interval, 21.6%-52.0%). At the 12-month 
      clinical evaluation, RIF severity was decreased in 50% of patients (n = 21; 95% 
      confidence interval, 34.2%-65.8%), and the patients' self-perception, mood state, 
      and social functioning were significantly improved. Pravastatin was well 
      tolerated, with a very low occurrence of grade 3 toxicities (myalgia, n = 1) and 
      grade 2 toxicities (myalgia/arthralgia or esophagitis, n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      phase 2 prospective study supports the notion of radioinduced fibrosis 
      reversibility. It showed that pravastatin (40 mg/d for 12 months) is an efficient 
      antifibrotic agent in patients with grade ≥2 cutaneous and subcutaneous fibrosis 
      after HNSCC radiation therapy.

AB  - This review discusses the clinical applications of magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) for the assessment of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) indication, axillary 
      lymph node status, preNAC cancer prognosis, early and intermediate response to 
      NAC, and post-NAC residual disease in patients with breast cancer. 
      Contrast-enhanced MRI with analysis of the tumor morphological features and 
      qualitative enhancement kinetics must be considered as the standard method for 
      pre-NAC breast cancer staging and post-NAC residual disease assessment. 
      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is easy to perform and may increase the 
      specificity of breast MRI for tumor staging, and also for the assessment of tumor 
      multifocality and multicentricity and lymph node status. It also provides an 
      ancillary added value in the early and post-NAC response evaluation. Changes in 
      the functional tumor volume are the main criterion for the early response 
      analysis. Other MRI methods, such as quantitative perfusion analysis, MR 
      spectroscopy and texture analysis, are still under study.

TI  - Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation: a specific sign of bowel necrosis in 
      closed-loop small-bowel obstruction.
PG  - 4225-4233
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5402-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify computed tomography (CT) findings associated with bowel 
      necrosis in patients with surgically confirmed strangulating closed-loop 
      small-bowel obstruction (CL-SBO) due to adhesions or internal hernia. METHODS: 
      This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and 
      informed consent was waived. To identify CT signs of bowel necrosis, two 
      gastrointestinal radiologists performed blinded, independent, retrospective 
      reviews of 41 CT studies from consecutive patients who had CL-SBO due to 
      adhesions or internal hernias and who underwent surgery within 48 h. On the basis 
      of surgical and pathological findings, patients were classified as having 
      reversible ischemia or histologically documented necrosis. Univariate statistical 
      analyses were performed to assess associations between CT signs and bowel 
      necrosis. Kappa statistics were computed to assess interobserver agreement. 
      RESULTS: We included 25 (61%) women and 16 (39%) men with a median age of 79 
      years. Bowel necrosis was found in 25/41 (61%) patients and ischemic but viable 
      bowel in 16/41 (39%) patients. Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation was 
      the only CT finding significantly associated with bowel necrosis (p = 0.0002). 
      This sign had 58% (95% CI, 37-78) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 79-100) 
      specificity for necrosis. Interobserver agreement was fair (0.59; 95% CI, 
      0.37-0.82). CONCLUSION: Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation is specific 
      for bowel necrosis and should lead to prompt surgery for bowel resection. KEY 
      POINTS: • Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation is the only sign specific 
      for necrosis • Decreased bowel-wall enhancement is not relevant for 
      differentiating reversible ischemia from necrosis • Preoperative knowledge of 
      bowel necrosis is helpful to plan adequate surgery.

TI  - Acute Jejunoileal Diverticulitis: Multicenter Descriptive Study of 33 Patients.
PG  - 1245-1251
LID - 10.2214/AJR.17.18777 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute jejunoileal diverticulitis is a very rare and potentially 
      serious disease affecting mostly elderly patients. The diagnosis is based on 
      imaging but remains underrecognized. The purpose of this study is to describe the 
      clinical and CT features and the outcomes of patients with acute jejunoileal 
      diverticulitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of acute jejunoileal diverticulitis 
      managed at three French hospitals November 2005 through January 2015 were 
      identified retrospectively. The final diagnosis relied either on a clinical and 
      radiologic data review by a panel of experts or on surgical findings. 
      Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and 18-month outcome data were collected. CT 
      scans were reviewed by two radiologists who reached a consensus about the 
      presence of an inflammatory diverticulum, evidence of complications, and presence 
      of other bowel diverticula. RESULTS: We identified 33 cases of acute jejunoileal 
      diverticulitis in 33 patients with a median age of 78 years, including 30 (91%) 
      patients in whom an inflammatory diverticulum was identified at the jejunum (n = 
      26, 87%) or ileum (n = 4, 13%). Extraintestinal gas was seen in 10 (30%) patients 
      and extraintestinal fluid in 11 (33%) patients. Other small-bowel diverticula 
      were visible in all 33 patients. The diverticulitis was mild and resolved with 
      nonoperative treatment in 22 (67%) patients and was severe in the remaining 11 
      (33%) patients, eight of whom required emergent surgery. CONCLUSION: Acute 
      jejunoileal diverticulitis is a rare and usually nonserious condition that 
      chiefly involves the jejunum. A detailed CT assessment may allow nonoperative 
      treatment.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of CT signs for predicting adnexal torsion in women 
      presenting with an adnexal mass and abdominal pain: A case-control study.
PG  - 75-81
LID - S0720-048X(17)30493-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.11.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine which CT findings or combinations of CT findings could 
      accurately identify adnexal torsion in a cohort of women admitted for abdominal 
      pain and presenting with an adnexal mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local 
      institutional review board approved this retrospective case-control study 
      involving adults-the informed consent requirement was waived. Enhanced computed 
      tomography (CT) findings of 32 consecutive adnexal torsion and 32 control 
      patients admitted for abdominal pain and presenting with an adnexal mass were 
      independently reviewed by two radiologists, with consensus by a third one, for 
      all CT findings commonly assessed in adnexal torsion. All twisted and untwisted 
      adnexa were confirmed by surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were 
      performed for adnexal torsion prediction. RESULTS: The median patient age was 41 
      years (interquartile range, 30.5-62 years). Only benign masses were encountered 
      in the torsion group. Five CT features were significantly associated with adnexal 
      torsion: a large ovary with a threshold at 80mm (p=0.005), median or 
      contralateral displacement of the adnexa (p=0.00014), asymmetric wall thickening 
      of the mass (p<0.0001), inter-utero-ovarian mass (p<0.0001) and whirlpool sign 
      (p=0.0006). In the multivariate analysis, only the inter-utero-ovarian mass was 
      independently associated with adnexal torsion (odds ratio=130 (CI95%: 
      15-infinite), p<0.0001) with an excellent overall diagnostic performance 
      (AUC=0.89; CI95%: 0.81-0.97). It was a sensitive (Se=97%, CI95%: 84-100) and 
      specific feature (Sp=81%, CI95%: 64-93). CONCLUSION: An inter-utero-ovarian mass 
      is an accurate and reliable CT finding for diagnosing adnexal torsion in patients 
      with acute abdominal pain and an adnexal mass.

TI  - Clinical Relevance of the Feces Sign in Small-Bowel Obstruction Due to Adhesions 
      Depends on Its Location.
PG  - 78-84
LID - 10.2214/AJR.17.18126 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate if the feces sign can be 
      used to predict successful nonoperative treatment or progression to ischemia in 
      patients with small-bowel obstruction (SBO) due to adhesions. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: For this single-center retrospective observational study involving a 
      blinded independent review by two radiologists of 237 consecutive CT examinations 
      of 216 patients with SBO due to adhesions (age: mean, 70.9 years; median, 74 
      years; interquartile range, 62-84 years), the location of the transition zone 
      (TZ), number of TZs, and presence and location of the feces sign relative to the 
      TZ were recorded. The reference standard for diagnosing ischemia was surgical and 
      pathologic findings (n = 108 CT examinations) or, when treatment was nonoperative 
      (n = 129 CT examinations), clinical outcome. Factors associated with successful 
      nonoperative treatment and ischemia were identified by univariate and 
      multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A feces sign was seen in 88 of 237 CT 
      examinations (37.1%). The feces sign was at the TZ, which we refer to as the "TZ 
      feces" sign, in 82 of 88 (93.2%) patients; between two TZs, which we refer to as 
      the "trapped feces" sign, in 14 (15.9%) patients; and in both locations in eight 
      (9.1%) patients. By univariate analysis, an isolated TZ feces sign was associated 
      positively with successful nonoperative treatment (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% CI, 
      1.71-6.66; p < 0.001) and negatively with ischemia (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.85; 
      p = 0.02). Combined TZ and trapped feces signs were associated with ischemia (OR, 
      24.16; 95% CI, 2.86-203.89; p = 0.003). By multivariate analysis, regardless of 
      the location of the feces sign, the feces sign was not significantly associated 
      with successful nonoperative treatment or progression to ischemia. CONCLUSION: 
      The feces sign is common and helps to identify the TZ. Among the CT signs of SBO, 
      the feces sign does not independently help to predict successful nonoperative 
      treatment or progression to ischemia.

TI  - How to differentiate acute pelvic inflammatory disease from acute appendicitis ? 
      A decision tree based on CT findings.
PG  - 673-682
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-5032-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To construct a decision tree based on CT findings to differentiate acute 
      pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from acute appendicitis (AA) in women with 
      lower abdominal pain and inflammatory syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board and informed 
      consent was waived. Contrast-enhanced CT studies of 109 women with acute PID and 
      218 age-matched women with AA were retrospectively and independently reviewed by 
      two radiologists to identify CT findings predictive of PID or AA. Surgical and 
      laboratory data were used for the PID and AA reference standard. Appropriate 
      tests were performed to compare PID and AA and a CT decision tree using the 
      classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm was generated. RESULTS: The 
      median patient age was 28 years (interquartile range, 22-39 years). According to 
      the decision tree, an appendiceal diameter ≥ 7 mm was the most discriminating 
      criterion for differentiating acute PID and AA, followed by a left tubal diameter 
      ≥ 10 mm, with a global accuracy of 98.2 % (95 % CI: 96-99.4). CONCLUSION: 
      Appendiceal diameter and left tubal thickening are the most discriminating CT 
      criteria for differentiating acute PID from AA. KEY POINTS: • Appendiceal 
      diameter and marked left tubal thickening allow differentiating PID from AA. • 
      PID should be considered if appendiceal diameter is < 7 mm. • Marked left tubal 
      diameter indicates PID rather than AA when enlarged appendix. • No pathological 
      CT findings were identified in 5 % of PID patients.

TI  - Assessment of Strangulation in Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction on the Basis of 
      Combined CT Findings: Implications for Clinical Care.
PG  - 798-808
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2017162352 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To determine which computed tomography (CT) findings or combinations of 
      findings can help to accurately identify strangulation in adhesive small bowel 
      obstruction (SBO). Materials and Methods Contrast agent-enhanced CT findings in a 
      cohort of 256 patients consecutively admitted for adhesive SBO, with a delay of 
      less than 24 hours between CT and surgery for the operated patients, were 
      reviewed independently by two radiologists, with consensus by a third, to assess 
      CT findings commonly associated with strangulation. The reference standard for 
      strangulation was surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to 
      identify predictors of strangulation in the entire cohort and to identify 
      predictors of the need for surgical resection in the subgroup of patients with 
      strangulation. A CT score was obtained and diagnostic performances of different 
      combined CT findings were calculated. Results In this study, 105 patients (41.0%; 
      105 of 256) underwent a surgical procedure, 62 of whom were found to have 
      strangulation (59.0%; 62 of 105), whereas 151 patients (59.0%; 151 of 256) 
      improved with medical care. Three CT findings were significantly associated with 
      strangulation in the multivariate analysis: reduced bowel wall enhancement (odds 
      ratio, 7.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 23.5), diffuse mesenteric haziness 
      (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% CI: 2.5, 15.2), and a closed-loop mechanism (odds ratio, 
      6.5; 95% CI: 2.8, 15.5). The model combining these three features had an area 
      under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.96) and a high negative predictive value 
      (97%; 95% CI: 93%, 99%). Positive likelihood ratios were high when two or three 
      of these CT findings were combined (positive likelihood ratios, 14.7 [95% CI: 
      7.1, 30.4] and 43.8 (95% CI: 14.2, 135.2], respectively). Among the strangulated 
      cases, reduced bowel wall enhancement (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 12) and 
      mesenteric fluid (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 12.8) were predictive of 
      resection. Conclusion A score that combines three CT findings (reduced bowel wall 
      enhancement, a closed-loop mechanism, and diffuse mesenteric haziness) can 
      accurately predict strangulation in adhesive SBO. (©) RSNA, 2017 Online
