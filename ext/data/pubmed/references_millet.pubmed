AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of present study was to assess the association between acute 
      post-traumatic atrophy (APTMA) determined on psoas computed tomography [CT] scan 
      and the duration of mechanical ventilation and outcomes in severe trauma 
      patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of severe trauma patients (Injury 
      Severity Score [ISS], >15) hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) for more 
      than 7 days between January 2010 and December 2015 was performed. The psoas 
      muscle index (PMI) was measured on admission and at delayed CT scan. ΔPMI was 
      calculated as the percentage PMI loss between these two scans. Three groups were 
      defined and compared a posteriori using the quartiles of the ΔPMI values: low 
      (lower quartile), moderate, and severe (higher quartile) APTMA groups. Linear 
      regression analysis was performed to predict the duration of mechanical 
      ventilation, of catecholamines, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU and hospital, and 
      complications were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 114 trauma patients were 
      included (median age, 40 years; [IQR, 25-54 years]; ISS, 33 [IQR, 25-41]). Based 
      on the ΔPMI determination, 29 patients were allocated in the low APTMA group 
      (range ∆PMI, 0%-6%), 56 in the moderate APTMA group (range ∆PMI, 6%-18%), and 29 
      in the APTMA group (range ∆PMI, ≥19%). Severity of APTMA was significantly 
      associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation and catecholamines, ICU 
      and hospital LOS (P<0.001). Delayed pneumonia (P=0.006) and other delayed 
      infections (P=0.014), as well as thromboembolic events (P=0.04) were 
      statistically associated with the severity of APTMA, whereas mortality did not 
      differ between the three groups (P=0.20). Using linear regression analysis, each 
      ∆PMI increase of 1% was significantly associated with 0.90 supplementary days of 
      mechanical ventilation (P<0.001), 0.29 supplementary days of catecholamines 
      (P<0.001) and 0.82 supplementary days of hospitalization (P<0.001). All these 
      statistical associations were confirmed in multivariate analysis (P<0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Acute muscle atrophy diagnosed on CT scan by psoas area measurement 
      (ΔPMI) was strongly associated with poor outcomes in severe trauma patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple scoring system in order to predict the risk of 
      severe (death and/or surgery) ischemic colitis METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, 205 patients diagnosed with ischemic colitis in a tertiary hospital were 
      consecutively included over a 6-year period. The study sample was sequentially 
      divided into a training cohort (n = 103) and a validation cohort (n = 102). In 
      the training cohort, multivariable analysis was used to identify clinical, 
      biological, and CT variables associated with poor outcome and to build a risk 
      scoring system. The discriminative ability of the score (sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) was estimated 
      in the two cohorts to externally validate the score, and a receiver operating 
      characteristic curve was established to estimate the area under the curve of the 
      score. Bootstrapping was used to validate the score internally. RESULTS: In the 
      training cohort, four independent variables were associated with unfavorable 
      outcome: hemodynamic instability (2 pts), involvement of the small bowel (1 pt), 
      paper-thin wall pattern (3 pts), no stratified enhancement pattern (1 pt). The 
      score was used to categorize patients into low risk (score: 0, 1), high risk 
      (score: 2-3), and very high risk (score: 4-7) groups with sensitivity and 
      specificity of 97% and 67%, respectively, and a good discriminating capability, 
      with a C-statistic of 0.94. Internal and external validation showed good 
      discrimination capability (C-statistics of 0.9 and 0.84, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: A simple risk score can stratify patients into three distinct 
      prognosis groups, which can optimize patient management. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: 
      NCT04662268 KEY POINTS: • Simple scoring system predicting the risk of severe 
      ischemic colitis • First study to include CT findings to the clinical and 
      biological data used to determine a severity score.

TI  - How to improve O-RADS MRI score for rating adnexal masses with cystic component?
PG  - 5943-5953
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08644-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the performance of the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting Data System 
      (O-RADS) MRI in characterizing adnexal masses with cystic components and to test 
      new specific MRI features related to cystic components to improve the ability of 
      the O-RADS MRI score to stratify lesions according to their risk of malignancy. 
      METHODS: The EURopean ADnexal study (EURAD) database was retrospectively queried 
      to identify adnexal masses with a cystic component. One junior and 13 
      radiologists independently reviewed cases blinded to the pathological diagnosis. 
      For each lesion, the size of the whole lesion, morphological appearance, number 
      of loculi, presence of a thickened wall, thickened septae, signal intensity of 
      the cystic components on T1-weighted/T2-weighted/diffusion weighted, mean value 
      of the apparent diffusion coefficient, and O-RADS MRI score were reported. 
      Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to 
      determine significant features to predict malignancy. RESULTS: The final cohort 
      consisted of 585 patients with 779 pelvic masses who underwent pelvic MRI to 
      characterize an adnexal mass(es). Histology served as the standard of reference. 
      The diagnostic performance of the O-RADS MRI score was 0.944, (95%)CI 
      [0.922-0.961]. Significant criteria associated with malignancy included an O-RADS 
      MRI score ≥ 4, ADC(mean) of cystic component > 1.69, number of loculi > 3, lesion 
      size > 75 mm, the presence of a thick wall, and a low T1-weighted, a high 
      T2-weighted, and a low diffusion-weighted signal intensity of the cystic 
      component. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that an O-RADS MRI score ≥ combined 
      with an ADC mean of the cystic component > 1.69, size > 75 mm, and low 
      diffusion-weighted signal of the cystic component significantly improved the 
      diagnostic performance up to 0.958, (95%)CI [0.938-0.973]. CONCLUSION: Cystic 
      component analysis may improve the diagnosis performance of the O-RADS MRI score 
      in adnexal cystic masses. KEY POINTS: • O-RADS MRI score combined with specific 
      cystic features (area under the receiving operating curve, AUROC = 0.958) 
      improves the diagnostic performance of the O-RADS MRI score (AUROC = 0.944) for 
      predicting malignancy in this cohort. • Cystic features that improve the 
      prediction of malignancy are ADC mean > 1.69 (OR = 7); number of loculi ≥ 3 (OR = 
      5.16); lesion size > 75 mm (OR = 4.40); the presence of a thick wall (OR = 3.59); 
      a high T2-weighted signal intensity score 4 or 5 (OR = 3.30); a low T1-weighted 
      signal intensity score 1, 2, or 3 (OR = 3.45); and a low diffusion-weighted 
      signal intensity (OR = 2.12). • An adnexal lesion with a cystic component rated 
      O-RADS MRI score 4 and an ADC value of the cystic component < 1.69 associated 
      with a low diffusion-weighted signal, has virtually a 0% risk of malignancy.

TI  - O-RADS MRI Classification of Indeterminate Adnexal Lesions: Time-Intensity Curve 
      Analysis Is Better Than Visual Assessment.
PG  - 566-575
LID - 10.1148/radiol.210342 [doi]
AB  - Background The MRI Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) enables 
      risk stratification of sonographically indeterminate adnexal lesions, partly 
      based on time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis, which may not be universally 
      available. Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment with 
      that of TIC assessment of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans to categorize 
      adnexal lesions as benign or malignant and to evaluate the influence on the 
      O-RADS MRI score. Materials and Methods The European Adnex MR Study Group, or 
      EURAD, database, a prospective multicenter study of women undergoing MRI for 
      indeterminate adnexal lesions between March 2013 and March 2018, was queried 
      retrospectively. Women undergoing surgery for an adnexal lesion with solid tissue 
      were included. Solid tissue enhancement relative to outer myometrium was assessed 
      visually and with TIC. Contrast material washout was recorded. Lesions were 
      categorized according to the O-RADS MRI score with visual and TIC assessment. 
      Per-lesion diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Results A total of 320 lesions 
      (207 malignant, 113 benign) in 244 women (mean age, 55.3 years ± 15.8 [standard 
      deviation]) were analyzed. Sensitivity for malignancy was 96% (198 of 207) and 
      76% (157 of 207) for TIC and visual assessment, respectively. TIC was more 
      accurate than visual assessment (86% [95% CI: 81, 90] vs 78% [95% CI: 73, 82]; P 
      < .001) for benign lesions, predominantly because of higher specificity (95% [95% 
      CI: 92, 98] vs 76% [95% CI: 68, 81]). A total of 21% (38 of 177) of invasive 
      lesions were rated as low risk visually. Contrast material washout and high-risk 
      enhancement (defined as earlier enhancement than in the myometrium) were highly 
      specific for malignancy for both TIC (97% [95% CI: 91, 99] and 94% [95% CI: 90, 
      97], respectively) and visual assessment (97% [95% CI: 92, 99] and 93% [95% CI: 
      88, 97], respectively). O-RADS MRI score was more accurate with TIC than with 
      visual assessment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87 
      [95% CI: 0.83, 0.90] vs 0.73 [95% CI: 0.68, 0.78]; P < .001). Conclusion 
      Time-intensity curve analysis was more accurate than visual assessment for 
      achieving optimal diagnostic accuracy with the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data 
      System MRI score. Clinical trial registration no. NCT01738789 © RSNA, 2022 Online

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to evaluate electromagnetic extracorporeal shockwave 
      lithotripsy (SWL) in treating high-density radiopaque ureteral stones on 
      non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients 
      with radiopaque stones in the ureter who underwent SWL in a high volume center 
      between 2016 and 2017 were retrospectively included. NCCT characteristics such as 
      mean stone density (MSD), stone size, skin to stone distance (SSD) were recorded 
      before treatment. Treatment success was defined as complete stone clearance (SF). 
      RESULTS: 108 patients were included. Global stones MSD was 1119 HU. 55% and 62% 
      of patients were SF respectively after 1 and 2 sessions of SWL. There was no 
      difference of success rates between the treatment of low MSD (<1000 HU, n=33) and 
      high MSD (≥1000 HU, n=75) (P=0.57, OR=0.79, 95% CI [0.35-1.80]). The SF rate 
      dropped to 31.6% for 19 patients with ureteral stenting before treatment (P=0.02, 
      OR=3.34, 95% CI [1.16-9.62]). Mean stone size was 7.2mm, SF rate for stones over 
      7mm were statistically lower (P=0.04, OR=2.18, 95% CI [1.00-4.73]). 4 patients 
      needed ureteral stenting in emergency after SWL (3.7%). DISCUSSION: 
      Electromagnetic SWL is a safe and effective way to treat ureteral stones. A 
      high-density stone on NCCT may not be detrimental. Many parameters should be 
      involved in the treatment decision such as stone size and ureteral stenting. 
      LEVEL OF PROOF: 4.

TI  - Canal of Nuck Abnormalities in Pediatric Female Patients.
PG  - 541-558
LID - 10.1148/rg.210145 [doi]
AB  - A groin lump is not an uncommon condition in girls and female infants, and US 
      plays a fundamental role in its exploration. The main pathologic conditions are 
      related to the failure of obliteration of the canal of Nuck. Radiologists should 
      gain a full understanding of the embryology and US anatomy of the inguinal canal 
      before assessing this entity for the first time. An optimal age-adjusted US 
      technique-including examinations at rest and during straining-is essential to 
      help assess the canal of Nuck, diagnose a hernia, and analyze its content. The 
      radiologist must be aware of the various types of hernial content depending on 
      the patient's age, including intestinal, omental, ovarian, or tubouterine hernia, 
      and the US features of each. Incarcerated hernias are common in girls and mostly 
      contain an ovary. In such cases, it is crucial to screen for US signs suggestive 
      of ovarian ischemic damage, thereby calling for urgent surgery. US can also 
      depict a cyst or hydrocele of the canal of Nuck and its complications. Moreover, 
      other rare pathologic conditions involving the inguinal area may be depicted at 
      US, which helps guide appropriate treatment. US is the ideal modality for 
      evaluating an inguinal lump in girls and female infants. Online supplemental 
      material is available for this article. (©)RSNA, 2022.

TI  - Injury characteristics, initial clinical status, and severe injuries associated 
      with spinal fractures in a retrospective cohort of 506 trauma patients.
PG  - 527-536
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000003249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to describe the characteristics of vertebral fractures, 
      the presence of associated injuries, and clinical status within the first days in 
      a severe trauma population. METHODS: All patients with severe trauma admitted to 
      our level 1 trauma center between January 2015 and December 2018 with a vertebral 
      fracture were analyzed retrospectively. The fractures were determined by the AO 
      Spine classification as stable (A0, A1, and A2 types) or unstable (A3, A4, B, and 
      C types). Clinical status was defined as stable, intermediate, or unstable based 
      on clinicobiological parameters and anatomic injuries. Severe extraspinal 
      injuries and emergent procedures were studied. Three groups were compared: stable 
      fracture, unstable fracture, and spinal cord injury (SCI) group. RESULTS: A total 
      of 425 patients were included (mean ± SD age, 43.8 ± 19.6 years; median Injury 
      Severity Score, 22 [interquartile range, 17-34]; 72% male); 72 (17%) in the SCI 
      group, 116 (27%) in the unstable fracture group, and 237 (56%) in the stable 
      fracture group; 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57-67%) had not a stable 
      clinical status on admission (unstable, 30%; intermediate, 32%), regardless of 
      the group (p = 0.38). This decreased to 31% (95% CI, 27-35%) on day 3 and 23% 
      (95% CI, 19-27%) on day 5, regardless of the group (p = 0.27 and p = 0.25). 
      Progression toward stable clinical status between D1 and D5 was 63% (95% CI, 
      58-68%) overall but was statistically lower in the SCI group. Severe extraspinal 
      injuries (85% [95% CI, 82-89%]) and extraspinal emergent procedures (56% [95% CI, 
      52-61%]) were comparable between the three groups. Only abdominal injuries and 
      hemostatic procedures significantly differed significantly (p = 0.003 and p = 
      0.009). CONCLUSION: More than the half of the patients with severe trauma had 
      altered initial clinical status or severe extraspinal injuries that were not 
      compatible with safe early surgical management for the vertebral fracture. These 
      observations were independent of the stability of the fracture or the presence of 
      an SCI. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic and epidemiological, level III.

TI  - Reader performances in breast lesion characterization via DBT: One or two views 
      and which view?

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the performance in breast lesion characterization of one-view 
      mediolateral (MLO) digital mammography plus digital breast tomosynthesis (DM-DBT) 
      versus one-view craniocaudal (CC) DM-DBT versus two-view DM-DBT. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study 
      conducted on 138 women from the population of a previous prospective multicenter 
      study, with 69 consecutive patients with benign or high-risk lesions and 69 
      randomized patients with breast cancer, all confirmed at pathology. Four 
      radiologists (two senior and two junior) blinded to the clinical, mammographic 
      and pathological data independently reviewed the MLO DM-DBT views, the CC DM-DBT 
      views and the MLO + CC DM-DBT views using the American College of Radiology 
      Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System criteria for index lesion 
      characterization. Areas under the receiver were calculated and compared for each 
      reader and imaging protocol. RESULTS: No significant differences in breast cancer 
      characterization were observed between single MLO and CC views for all the 
      readers. The added value of a second view was statistically significant for 
      characterization in pooled data and for junior readers but not for senior readers 
      (p ranging from 0.15 to 0.57 depending on the view and the senior reader). 
      Finally, in 4 breast cancer cases, lesions were only detectable on the CC DM-DBT 
      view in two cases and on the MLO DM-DBT view in the two other cases. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results support the use of two-view DM-DBT for breast lesion characterization 
      when the readers are inexperienced. There is no significant difference between CC 
      and MLO views when diagnosis is performed with one view.

TI  - O-RADS MRI score: analysis of misclassified cases in a prospective multicentric 
      European cohort.
PG  - 9588-9599
LID - 10.1007/s00330-021-08054-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively review the causes of categorization errors using 
      O-RADS-MRI score and to determine the presumptive causes of these 
      misclassifications. METHODS: EURAD database was retrospectively queried to 
      identify misclassified lesions. In this cohort, 1194 evaluable patients with 1502 
      pelvic masses (277 malignant / 1225 benign lesions) underwent standardized MRI to 
      characterize adnexal masses with histology or 2 years' follow-up as a reference 
      standard. An expert radiologist reviewed cases with two junior radiologists and 
      lesions termed misclassified if malignant lesion was scored ≤ 3, a benign lesion 
      was scored ≥ 4, the site of origin was incorrect, or a non-adnexal mass was 
      incorrectly categorized as benign or malignant. RESULTS: There were 139 / 1502 
      (9.2%) misclassified masses in 116 women including 109 adnexal and 30 non-adnexal 
      masses. False-negative cases corresponded to 16 borderline or invasive malignant 
      adnexal masses rated score ≤ 3 (16 / 139, 11.5%). False-positive cases 
      corresponded to 88 benign masses were rated score 4 (67 / 139, 48.2%) or 5 (18 / 
      139,12.9%) or considered suspicious non-adnexal lesions (3 / 139, 2.2%). 
      Misclassifications were only due to origin error in 12 adnexal masses (8 benign, 
      4 malignant) (8.6%, 12 / 139) and 23 non-adnexal masses (18 benign, 5 
      malignant,16.5%, 23 / 139) perceived respectively as non-adnexal and adnexal 
      masses. Interpretive error (n = 104), failure to recognize technical insufficient 
      exams (n = 9), and perceptual errors (n = 4) were found. Most interpretive was 
      due to misinterpretation of solid tissue or incorrect assignment of mass origin. 
      Eighty-four out of 139 cases were correctly reclassified by the readers with 
      strict adherence to the score rules. CONCLUSION: Most errors were due to 
      misinterpretation of solid tissue or incorrect assignment of mass origin. KEY 
      POINTS: • Prospective assignment of O-RADS-MRI score resulted in 
      misclassification of 9.25% of sonographically indeterminate pelvic masses. • Most 
      errors were interpretive (74.8%) due to misinterpretation of solid tissue as 
      defined by the lexicon or incorrect assignment of mass origin. • Pelvic 
      inflammatory disease is a common source of misclassification (8.9%) (12 / 139).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess CT signs to discriminate an appendiceal tumor versus a 
      non-tumoral appendix in an acute appendicitis context. METHODS: A 10-year 
      bicentric retrospective case-control study was performed in adults. Patients with 
      a histopathological appendiceal tumor and appendicitis were paired for age and 
      sex with patients with non-tumorous appendicitis (1/3 ratio, respectively). Two 
      senior radiologists blindly analyzed numerous CT findings with final consensus to 
      perform univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. A diagnostic CT scan 
      score was calculated with a bootstrap internal validation. Reproducibility was 
      assessed based on the kappa statistic. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients (51 +/- 
      21 years; 114 males) were included (52 patients in the tumor group and 156 in the 
      non-tumor group). In the multivariate analysis, an appendicolith and fat 
      stranding were protective factors with OR = 0.2 (p = 0.01) and OR = 0.3 
      (p = 0.02), respectively, while mural calcifications (OR = 47, p = 0.0001), an 
      appendix mass (OR = 7.1, p = 0.008), a focal asymmetric wall abnormality 
      (OR = 4.9, p = 0, 001), or a ≥ 15 mm diameter (OR = 3.5, p = 0.009) were positive 
      predictive factors of an underlying tumor. Using a ≥1 cut-off, our diagnostic 
      score had an AUC = 0.87 (95 % CI, 0.82-0.93) and a positive likelihood 
      ratio = 13.5 (95 % CI, 6.7-27.1). CONCLUSION: We developed a reliable scoring 
      system based on CT findings, which is highly predictive of an underlying 
      appendiceal neoplasm in an appendicitis context using a ≥1 cut-off.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The French Society of Digestive Surgery (SFCD) and the Society of 
      Abdominal and Digestive Imaging (SIAD) have collaborated to propose 
      recommendations for clinical practice in the management of adult appendicitis. 
      METHODS: An analysis of the literature was carried out according to the 
      methodology of the French National Authority for Health (HAS). A selection was 
      performed from collected references and then a manual review of the references 
      listed in the selected articles was made in search of additional relevant 
      articles. The research was limited to articles whose language of publication was 
      English or French. Articles focusing on the pediatric population were excluded. 
      Based on the literature review, the working group proposed recommendations 
      whenever possible. These recommendations were reviewed and approved by a 
      committee of experts. RESULTS: Recommendations about appendicitis in adult 
      patients were proposed with regard to clinical, laboratory and radiological 
      diagnostic modalities, treatment strategy for uncomplicated and complicated 
      appendicitis, surgical technique, and specificities in the case of 
      macroscopically healthy appendix, terminal ileitis and appendicitis in the 
      elderly and in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: These recommendations for clinical 
      practice may be useful to the surgeon in optimizing the management of acute 
      appendicitis in adults.

TI  - Imaging strategies for patients with suspicion of uncomplicated colic pain: 
      diagnostic accuracy and management assessment.
PG  - 2983-2993
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-07264-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare different imaging scenarios in the diagnosis of uncomplicated 
      renal colic due to urolithiasis (URCU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 206 
      prospectively included patients had been admitted with suspected URCU and had 
      undergone abdominal plain film (APF), US and unenhanced CT after clinical STONE 
      score evaluation. CT was the reference standard. We assessed sensitivity (Se), 
      specificity (Spe) and Youden index for colic pain diagnosis, percentage of 
      patients managed by urologic treatment with stone identified, percentage of 
      alternative diagnoses (AD) and exposure to radiation, according to single imaging 
      approaches, strategies driven by patient characteristics and conditional imaging 
      strategies after APF and US. RESULTS: One hundred (48.5%) patients had a final 
      diagnosis of URCU and 19 underwent urologic treatment. The conditional strategy, 
      i.e. CT in patients who had no stone identified at US, had a perfect sensitivity 
      and specificity. This enabled diagnosis of all stones requiring urology 
      management while decreasing the number of CT exams by 22%. The strategy whereby 
      CT was used when there was neither direct or indirect APF + US finding of colic 
      pain nor alternative diagnoses in patients with a STONE score ≥ 10 had a 
      sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.99, identified 84% of stones managed 
      by urologic treatment and decreased the number of CT examinations by 76%. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with clinical findings consistent with URCU, the use of 
      ultrasound as first-line imaging modality, with CT restricted to patients with 
      negative US and a STONE score ≥ 10, led to a sensitivity and specificity of above 
      95%, identified 84% of stones requiring urological management and reduced the 
      number of CT scans needed by fourfold. KEY POINTS: • For diagnosis, the use of 
      APF + US as first-line imaging, with CT restricted to patients with both a normal 
      APF + US and a STONE score ≥ 10, provides both a sensitivity and specificity 
      superior or equal to 95% and reduces the number of CT scans necessary by 
      fourfold. • For management, the use of APF + US as first-line imaging, with CT 
      restricted to patients with both a normal APF + US and a STONE score ≥ 10, 
      maintains a 84% stone identification rate in urology-treated patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: In 2016, the Herault tumor registry collected 1961cancers in urology 
      (21.4 % from all Herault cancers this year). RHESOU was created to complete RTH' 
      data with specific parameters in onco-urology. The aim of this study is to 
      describe RHESOU and to give some examples with our first results. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: In November 2018, RHESOU (Registry HErault Specialised in Onco-Urology) 
      was founded with the same registry recommendations. It collects specific 
      oncologic parameters and also complete RTH's data. For each urological cancer, a 
      specific survey with different choices was performed to collect a maximum of data 
      which could be present in patients' file. These surveys were used for urological 
      cancers cases that live in Herault in 2017. RESULTS: In 2017, we collected 
      970 prostate cancers, 581 bladder cancers, 212 kidney cancers, 51 upper excretory 
      tract cancers, 28 testicle cancers and 9 penil cancers. Our urological data 
      collection gives many possibilities to create many requests for detailed analysis 
      in urological cancers. In this article, we reported data from kidney, bladder and 
      prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS: RHESOU is a new tool opened to the different 
      urologic corporations (urologists, pathologists, oncologists, radiotherapists, 
      radiologists) that permits an overview in urological cancers in Herault. Finally, 
      one important aim is that this tool will be adapted when new treatments or new 
      important parameters appear in the years ahead. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - Large bowel obstruction (LBO) is associated with high morbidity and mortality due 
      to delayed diagnosis and/or treatment. MDCT has become the standard of care to 
      identify the site, severity, and etiology of obstruction. The goal of this review 
      is fourfold. The first objective is to give clues to differentiate LBO from 
      colonic pseudo-obstruction. The second objective is to describe CT features in 
      the most common cause of LBO which is colonic cancer by illustrating classical 
      and atypical features of colonic cancer responsible for LBO and by giving the 
      features which must be reported when differentiating malignant from benign: 
      presence of local lymph nodes, other colic localizations, length of involved 
      segment, presence of diverticula, or other. The third objective is to illustrate 
      the various causes of LBO which can mimic a colon cancer by leading to a 
      thickening of the colonic wall: diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, endometriosis, 
      inflammatory disease and to give tips which permit to evoke another diagnosis 
      than a colon cancer in patient with a LBO and a thickening of the colic wall. The 
      fourth objective is to describe the common signs of cecal and sigmoid volvulus 
      and to give tips for a diagnosis sometimes difficult particularly for cecal 
      volvulus: one of two transition points according to the type of volvulus and the 
      presence of a whirl sign with a torsion of the mesenteric vessels.

TI  - Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction: Predictive Radiology to Improve Patient 
      Management.
PG  - 480-492
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2020192234 [doi]
AB  - Adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) remains one of the leading causes of 
      emergency room visits and is still associated with high morbidity and mortality 
      rates. Because the management of adhesive SBO has shifted from immediate surgery 
      to nonoperative treatment in the absence of ischemia, it is crucial to rapidly 
      detect or predict strangulation, which requires emergent surgery. CT is now 
      established as the best imaging technique for the initial assessment of patients 
      suspected of having adhesive SBO. CT helps confirm the diagnosis of mechanical 
      SBO, locate the site of obstruction, establish the cause, and detect 
      complications. This article is a review of the role of imaging in answering 
      specific questions to help predict the management needs of each individual 
      patient. It includes (a) an update on the best CT signs for predicting ischemia 
      and a need for bowel resection; (b) a discussion of the CT features that help 
      differentiate open-loop from closed-loop obstruction and a single adhesive band 
      from matted adhesions and how these differences can influence the management; and 
      (c) a review of the main CT predictors of the success or failure of nonoperative 
      management in adhesive SBO.

AB  - Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies worldwide. Over 
      the past 30 years, imaging has become central to the diagnosis of appendicitis, 
      reducing both negative appendicectomy rate and healthcare expenses. Appendicitis 
      can be challenging in many ways for radiologists with various clinical 
      presentations, complications and differential diagnoses. The aim of this review 
      is to present a step-by-step reasoning with key findings, tips and tricks leading 
      to the diagnosis of appendicitis and its complications. The first steps are with 
      the use of the appropriate imaging modality (US, CT and MRI) to locate the 
      appendix in abdominal cavity and to identify the features of appendicitis and its 
      complications through specific imaging signs. The next steps are to eliminate an 
      unusual morphology of the appendix that may simulate acute appendicitis and to 
      recognize an unusual imaging presentation of appendicitis. Then, to corroborate 
      the diagnosis of appendicitis, the last step is to rule out any differential 
      diagnoses mainly from the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Following 
      these steps can help to accurately diagnose appendicitis and its complications.

TI  - Mastitis in Autoimmune Diseases: Review of the Literature, Diagnostic Pathway, 
      and Pathophysiological Key Players.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9040958 [doi]
LID - 958
AB  - Mastitis frequently affects women of childbearing age. Of all the pathological 
      breast conditions requiring specific management, autoimmune mastitis is in the 
      third position after infection and breast cancer. The aim of this literature 
      review was to make a comprehensive description of autoimmune diseases targeting 
      the mammary gland. Four main histological patterns of autoimmune mastitis are 
      described: (i) lymphocytic infiltrates; (ii) ductal ectasia; (iii) granulomatous 
      mastitis; and (iv) vasculitis. Our literature search found that all types of 
      autoimmune disease may target the mammary gland: organ-specific diseases 
      (diabetes, thyroiditis); connective tissue diseases (such as systemic 
      erythematosus lupus or Sjögren's syndrome); vasculitides (granulomatosis with 
      polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, giant cell 
      arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Behçet's disease); granulomatous diseases 
      (sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease); and IgG4-related disease. Cases of 
      breast-specific autoimmune diseases have also been reported, including idiopathic 
      granulomatous mastitis. These breast-limited inflammatory diseases are sometimes 
      the first symptom of a systemic autoimmune disease. Although autoimmune mastitis 
      is rare, it is probably underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Early diagnosis may allow 
      us to detect systemic diseases at an earlier stage, which could help to initiate 
      a prompt, appropriate therapeutic strategy. In case of suspected autoimmune 
      mastitis, we hereby propose a diagnostic pathway and discuss the potential 
      pathophysiological pathways leading to autoimmune breast damage.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Approximately one-quarter of adnexal masses detected at 
      ultrasonography are indeterminate for benignity or malignancy, posing a 
      substantial clinical dilemma. OBJECTIVE: To validate the accuracy of a 5-point 
      Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting Data System Magnetic Resonance Imaging (O-RADS MRI) 
      score for risk stratification of adnexal masses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted between March 1, 2013, 
      and March 31, 2016. Among patients undergoing expectant management, 2-year 
      follow-up data were completed by March 31, 2018. A routine pelvic MRI was 
      performed among consecutive patients referred to characterize a sonographically 
      indeterminate adnexal mass according to routine diagnostic practice at 15 
      referral centers. The MRI score was prospectively applied by 2 onsite readers and 
      by 1 reader masked to clinical and ultrasonographic data. Data analysis was 
      conducted between April and November 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      primary end point was the joint analysis of true-negative and false-negative 
      rates according to the MRI score compared with the reference standard (ie, 
      histology or 2-year follow-up). RESULTS: A total of 1340 women (mean [range] age, 
      49 [18-96] years) were enrolled. Of 1194 evaluable women, 1130 (94.6%) had a 
      pelvic mass on MRI with a reference standard (surgery, 768 [67.9%]; 2-year 
      follow-up, 362 [32.1%]). A total of 203 patients (18.0%) had at least 1 malignant 
      adnexal or nonadnexal pelvic mass. No invasive cancer was assigned a score of 2. 
      Positive likelihood ratios were 0.01 for score 2, 0.27 for score 3, 4.42 for 
      score 4, and 38.81 for score 5. Area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve was 0.961 (95% CI, 0.948-0.971) among experienced readers, with a 
      sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96; 189 of 203 patients) and a specificity of 
      0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93; 848 of 927 patients). There was good interrater 
      agreement among both experienced and junior readers (κ = 0.784; 95% CI, 
      0.743-0824). Of 580 of 1130 women (51.3%) with a mass on MRI and no specific 
      gynecological symptoms, 362 (62.4%) underwent surgery. Of them, 244 (67.4%) had 
      benign lesions and a score of 3 or less. The MRI score correctly reclassified the 
      mass origin as nonadnexal with a sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99; 1360 of 
      1372 patients) and a specificity of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.85; 102 of 130 
      patients). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the O-RADS MRI score was 
      accurate when stratifying the risk of malignancy in adnexal masses.

TI  - Imaging protocols for renal multiparametric MRI and MR urography: results of a 
      consensus conference from the French Society of Genitourinary Imaging.
PG  - 2103-2114
LID - 10.1007/s00330-019-06530-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop technical guidelines for magnetic resonance imaging aimed 
      at characterising renal masses (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, 
      mpMRI) and at imaging the bladder and upper urinary tract (magnetic resonance 
      urography, MRU). METHODS: The French Society of Genitourinary Imaging organised a 
      Delphi consensus conference with a two-round Delphi survey followed by a 
      face-to-face meeting. Two separate questionnaires were issued for renal mpMRI and 
      for MRU. Consensus was strictly defined using a priori criteria. RESULTS: 
      Forty-two expert uroradiologists completed both survey rounds with no attrition 
      between the rounds. Fifty-six of 84 (67%) statements of the mpMRI questionnaire 
      and 44/71 (62%) statements of the MRU questionnaire reached final consensus. For 
      mpMRI, there was consensus that no injection of furosemide was needed and that 
      the imaging protocol should include T2-weighted imaging, dual chemical shift 
      imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value, 
      1000 s/mm(2)) and fat-saturated single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, 
      corticomedullary, nephrographic) contrast-enhanced imaging; late imaging (more 
      than 10 min after injection) was judged optional. For MRU, the patients should 
      void their bladder before the examination. The protocol must include T2-weighted 
      imaging, anatomical fast T1/T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use 
      of multiple b-values; maximal b-value, 1000 s/mm(2)) and fat-saturated 
      single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, excretory) 
      contrast-enhanced imaging. An intravenous injection of furosemide is mandatory 
      before the injection of contrast medium. Heavily T2-weighted 
      cholangiopancreatography-like imaging was judged optional. CONCLUSION: This 
      expert-based consensus conference provides recommendations to standardise 
      magnetic resonance imaging of kidneys, ureter and bladder. KEY POINTS: • 
      Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) aims at characterising renal 
      masses; magnetic resonance urography (MRU) aims at imaging the urinary bladder 
      and the collecting systems. • For mpMRI, no injection of furosemide is needed. • 
      For MRU, an intravenous injection of furosemide is mandatory before the injection 
      of contrast medium; heavily T2-weighted cholangiopancreatography-like imaging is 
      optional.

      or through the use of an abdominal compression device was not deemed necessary. 
      The patient should be imaged in the supine position and placed in the prone 
      position only at the radiologist's request. The choice between single-bolus and 
      split-bolus protocols depends on the context, but split-bolus protocols should be 
      favoured whenever possible to decrease patient irradiation. Repeated single-slice 
      test acquisitions should not be performed to decide of the timing of excretory 
      phase imaging; instead, excretory phase imaging should be performed 7 min after 
      the injection of the contrast medium. The optimal combination of unenhanced, 
      corticomedullary phase and nephrographic phase imaging depends on the context; 
      suggestions of protocols are provided for eight different clinical situations. 
      CONCLUSION: This expert-based consensus conference provides recommendations to 
      standardise the imaging protocol for computed tomography urography. KEY POINTS: • 
      To improve excretory phase imaging, an intravenous injection of furosemide should 
      be performed before the injection of iodinated contrast medium. • Systematic oral 
      or intravenous hydration is not necessary to improve excretory phase imaging. • 
      The choice between single-bolus and split-bolus protocols depends on the context, 
      but split-bolus protocols should be favoured whenever possible to decrease 
      patient irradiation.

TI  - A simple CT score to quantify pelvic and retroperitoneal hematoma associated with 
      pelvic fractures predicts transfusion needs, pelvic hemostatic procedures, and 
      outcome.
PG  - 173-184
LID - 10.1007/s10140-019-01745-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic and retroperitoneal hematoma (PRH) in case of pelvic fracture 
      may lead to early hemorrhagic shock. Quantifying PRH remains challenging in 
      clinical practice. The goal of this study was to determine the statistical 
      association between a semi-quantitative scoring system for PRH assessed with 
      computed tomography (CT) and transfusion needs, pelvic hemostatic procedures, and 
      outcome. METHODS: All consecutive severe trauma patients with pelvic ring 
      fracture between 2010 and 2015 were included in this retrospective study. PRH was 
      quantified using semi-quantitative analysis on admission CT scan. The pelvis and 
      retroperitoneal cavity was assessed as 10 compartments. Hematoma was counted as 0 
      (absent), 1 (minimal or moderate), and 2 (large or bilateral) for each 
      compartment (maximum score of 20). The patients were divided into the following 3 
      groups: no or minimal PRH (score 0-5), moderate PRH (6-9), and large PRH (10-20). 
      These groups were compared in terms of initial transfusion needs, massive 
      transfusion, hemostatic procedures, and outcome. Logistic regression and receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 
      311 patients with pelvic fracture (mean age 41.9, [SD] 19.9 years; mean ISS 27.4, 
      [SD] 19.4; unstable fractures, 32%; ≥5 units of packed red blood cells, 37%; 
      massive transfusion, 19%; multiple organ failure, 29%; mortality, 13%), divided 
      into no or minimal PRH group (128 (22%)), moderate PRH group (115 (37%)), and 
      large PRH group (68 (22%)). Increasing PRH was found to increase transfusion 
      needs and massive transfusions, with a higher number of pelvic hemostatic 
      procedures, multiple organ failures, increasing need for mechanical ventilation, 
      and prolonged hospitalization; mortality was also increased. These significant 
      statistical associations were confirmed by logistic regression models (odds 
      ratio, 1.2-12.1 for moderate PRH, 3.1-30.2 for large PRH) and ROC curve analysis 
      (area under the ROC curve, 0.59-0.76). CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative assessment 
      of PRH on admission CT scan allows to predict transfusion needs, hemostatic 
      procedures, and worse outcome of severe trauma patients with pelvic fracture.

TI  - CT diagnosis of closed loop bowel obstruction mechanism is not sufficient to 
      indicate emergent surgery.
PG  - 1105-1112
LID - 10.1007/s00330-019-06413-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify computed tomography (CT) findings associated with successful 
      conservative treatment of closed loop small bowel obstruction (CL-SBO) due to 
      adhesions or internal herniation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The local institutional 
      review board approved this study while waiving informed consent. Clinical and CT 
      data were collected retrospectively for 96 consecutive patients with a CT 
      diagnosis of CL-SBO due to adhesions or internal herniation established by 
      experienced radiologists who had no role in patient management. Mechanical 
      obstruction with at least two transition zones on the bowel at a single site 
      defined CL-SBO. Two radiologists blinded to patient data independently performed 
      a retrospective review of the CT scans. The patient groups with successful versus 
      failed initial conservative therapy were compared. Univariate and multivariate 
      analyses were performed to look for CT findings associated with successful 
      conservative therapy. Interobserver agreement was assessed for each CT finding. 
      RESULTS: Of the 96 patients, 34 (35%) underwent immediate surgery and 62 (65%) 
      received first-line conservative treatment, which succeeded in 19 (31%) and 
      failed in 43 (69%). The distance between the transition zones was the only 
      independent predictor of successful conservative therapy (odds ratio, 4.6 when 
      ≥ 8 mm; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-18.3). A distance ≥ 8 mm had 84% 
      (95% CI, 60-97) sensitivity and 46% (95% CI, 31-62) specificity for successful 
      conservative treatment. The correlation coefficient for the distance between 
      transition zones between readers 1 and 2 was fair (r = 0.46). CONCLUSION: CL-SBO 
      can be resolved without surgery. When there is no CT sign of ischemia, the 
      distance between the transition zones should be assessed. KEY POINTS: • Twenty 
      percent (19/96) of all cases of closed loop small bowel obstruction (CL-SBO) 
      representing 31% of the patients given first-line conservative therapy, were 
      resolved without surgery. • The distance between the transition zones may help to 
      choose between conservative and surgical management in patients with a CL-SBO but 
      no CT evidence of ischemia. • A distance < 8 mm between the transition zones 
      suggests a need for emergent surgery.

AB  - Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a new imaging technology that addresses the 
      limitation caused by overlapping structures in conventional two-dimensional 
      digital mammography owing to the acquisition of a series of low-dose projection 
      images. This unique technique provides a dual benefit to patients screened for 
      breast cancer. First, DBT increases the cancer detection rate mostly by 
      highlighting architectural distortions and allowing better assessment of masses 
      shape and margins. Second, DBT helps reduce recall rate by discarding asymmetries 
      related to overlapping tissue. However, DBT is not included in the majority of 
      cancer screening programs worldwide. Several issues still need to be addressed 
      such as over-diagnosis and over-treatment, lack of reduction of interval breast 
      cancer, quality control and storage, and radiation dose. In the diagnostic 
      setting, DBT increases the diagnostic accuracy and reduces the number of 
      indeterminate lesions in symptomatic women. Its aforementioned performances 
      regarding asymmetries, masses and architectural distortions allow reducing the 
      number of additional views while working-up a screening-detected lesion. Tumor 
      size is also better assessed at DBT as well as multicentricity, two significant 
      benefits in the staging of breast cancer. Finally, DBT allows a better analysis 
      of scars and helps reduce the rate of indeterminate findings after surgery. 
      Although somewhat limited by high breast density, DBT globally outperforms 
      digital mammography in both screening and diagnostic breast imaging. Additional 
      research is however needed, particularly on relevant screening outcomes. This 
      review describes the main performances of breast DBT in breast cancer screening 
      and diagnosis and the resulting consequences in both settings.

TI  - Local Tumor Staging of Breast Cancer: Digital Mammography versus Digital 
      Mammography Plus Tomosynthesis.
PG  - 594-603
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2019182457 [doi]
AB  - Background Combined digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis 
      (DBT) (hereafter, DM plus DBT) has increased cancer detection rates when compared 
      with those achieved with DM-only screening. However, there is limited literature 
      on DBT as an adjunct to mammography in the staging of known breast cancers. 
      Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of DM alone with that of DM plus DBT 
      in the identification of additional ipsilateral and contralateral lesions in 
      women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Materials and Methods This prospective 
      study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01881880) included 166 women with breast 
      cancer (mean age, 59.5 years ± 11; age range, 40-87 years) and used the 
      aforementioned techniques, with breast MRI and pathologic verification of all 
      suspected lesions as the reference standards. Four radiologists independently 
      reviewed the DM and DM plus DBT images using the American College of Radiology 
      Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems criteria for diagnosis of index lesions 
      and presence of additional disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained for DM and DM plus DBT 
      were compared by using the McNemar test. Results Twenty-four women (14%) 
      exhibited multifocal lesions; 20 (12%), multicentric lesions; 39 (23%), 
      additional ipsilateral lesions; and 18 (11%), bilateral lesions. The 
      sensitivities were higher for DM plus DBT than for DM in the diagnosis of 
      multicentric (51% [41 of 80] vs 37% [30 of 80], P = .002) and additional 
      ipsilateral (52% [81 of 156] vs 44% [69 of 156], P = .007) lesions. The AUC was 
      larger for DM plus DBT than for DM (0.74 vs 0.67, P = .02) in the diagnosis of 
      bilateral breast cancer. No significant differences in specificity were noted. 
      The added diagnostic value of DBT was limited to the group of women with nondense 
      breasts: For diagnosis of ipsilateral lesions, AUC of DM plus DBT versus DM was 
      0.74 versus 0.70 (P = .04). For diagnosis of contralateral lesions, AUC of DM 
      plus DBT verus DM was 0.76 versus 0.68 (P = .02). Conclusion The combination of 
      digital mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis improves diagnostic 
      accuracy for additional ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer in women with 
      nondense breasts. © RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Moy in this issue.

TI  - Assessment of the Exposure of People to Questing Ticks Carrying Agents of 
      Zoonoses in Aosta Valley, Italy.
LID - 10.3390/vetsci6010028 [doi]
LID - 28
AB  - We estimated the probability of exposure of people to questing ticks, infected 
      with bacterial agents of the tick-borne zoonoses-in Aosta Valley, western Alps, 
      Italy. We collected ticks by dragging, and from collectors' clothes in three 
      hiking trails, which were divided into an internal path, with short vegetation, 
      and an external part with taller grass. Dragging yielded 285 Ixodes ricinus 
      nymphs and 31 adults, and two Dermacentor marginatus adults. Eleven I. ricinus 
      nymphs and 9 adults were collected from collectors' clothes. Borrelia burgdorferi 
      s.l. was identified by PCR in 12 out of 30 I. ricinus nymphs (prevalence = 40.0%, 
      95% confidence interval = 22.5, 57.5). The prevalence of infection by Rickettsia 
      spp. was 13.3% (95% CI = 1.2, 25.5). The probability of encountering at least one 
      questing I. ricinus infected by each bacterial agent (probability of exposure, E) 
      in 100 m² was obtained by combining the number of collected nymphs, the 
      prevalence of infection by each bacterial agent, the frequency of passage by 
      visitors, and the probability of tick attachment to people. The mean number of 
      nymphs collected by dragging was greatest in the internal part of hiking trails 
      (mean = 7.9). Conversely, E was greater in the external part (up to 0.14 for B. 
      burgdorferi s.l., and 0.07 for Rickettsia spp.), due to a greater probability of 
      tick attachment to people in relatively tall vegetation.

TI  - Assessment of the Exposure of Turkey Farmers to Antimicrobial Resistance 
      Associated with Working Practices.
LID - 10.3390/vetsci6010013 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - The objective of the present study was the identification of farming practices in 
      the production of turkeys for human consumption, and their ranking in terms of 
      the occupational probability of exposure to antimicrobial resistant (AMR) 
      bacteria, for farm workers. We gathered evidence and data from scientific 
      literature, on risk factors for AMR in farmers, and on the prevalence of those 
      hazards across farming phases. We administered semi-structured interviews to 
      public and private veterinarians in Northern Italy, to obtain detailed 
      information on turkey farming phases, and on working practices. Data were then 
      integrated into a semi-quantitative Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA). 
      Those working practices, which are characterized by direct contact with numerous 
      animals, and which are carried out frequently, with rare use of personal 
      protection devices resulted as associated with the greatest probability of 
      exposure to AMR. For methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), these 
      included vaccination and administration of any individual therapy, and removal 
      and milling of litter, given the exposure of farmers to high dust level. Indeed, 
      levels of occupational exposure to MRSA are enhanced by its transmission routes, 
      which include direct contact with animal, as well as airborne transmission. Level 
      of exposure to extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) is more strictly 
      associated with direct contact and the oral-fecal route. Consequently, exposure 
      to ESBL resulted and associated with the routinely tipping over of poults turned 
      on their back, and with the individual administration of therapies.

TI  - Revised Atlanta classification for CT pancreatic and peripancreatic collections 
      in the first month of acute pancreatitis: interobserver agreement.
PG  - 2302-2310
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5906-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess interobserver agreement when using the revised Atlanta 
      classification (RAC) to categorize pancreatic and peripancreatic collections 
      during the first month of acute pancreatitis (AP), and to correlate type of 
      collection to outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study of 115 
      consecutive patients admitted for 123 AP episodes, 178 CTs performed within the 
      first month showed peripancreatic abnormalities. Each AP episode was classified 
      as mild, moderately severe, or severe based on the RAC. Two radiologists, blinded 
      to clinical data, used RAC criteria to retrospectively categorize the collections 
      as acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFC) or acute necrotic collections 
      (ANC). Interobserver agreement was assessed based on Cohen's κ statistics and 
      compared according to CT timing. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for 
      categorizing peripancreatic collections was moderate (κ = 0.45) and did not 
      improve with time to CT (κ values, 0.53 < day 3, 0.34 on days 3-6, and 0.43 ≥ day 
      7). For detecting parenchymal necrosis, interobserver agreement was also moderate 
      (κ = 0.45). AP was less severe in patients with APFC versus ANC (p = 0.04). 
      CONCLUSION: Our finding of moderate interobserver agreement when using the RAC to 
      categorize pancreatic and peripancreatic collections by CT indicates that the 
      accurate diagnosis of APFC or ANC by CT in the first 4 weeks after symptom onset 
      is often challenging. KEY POINTS: • Interobserver agreement was moderate for 
      categorizing peripancreatic collections. • Interobserver agreement did not 
      improve with time from onset to CT. • Interobserver agreement was moderate for 
      detecting parenchymal necrosis.

AB  - This review discusses the clinical applications of magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) for the assessment of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) indication, axillary 
      lymph node status, preNAC cancer prognosis, early and intermediate response to 
      NAC, and post-NAC residual disease in patients with breast cancer. 
      Contrast-enhanced MRI with analysis of the tumor morphological features and 
      qualitative enhancement kinetics must be considered as the standard method for 
      pre-NAC breast cancer staging and post-NAC residual disease assessment. 
      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is easy to perform and may increase the 
      specificity of breast MRI for tumor staging, and also for the assessment of tumor 
      multifocality and multicentricity and lymph node status. It also provides an 
      ancillary added value in the early and post-NAC response evaluation. Changes in 
      the functional tumor volume are the main criterion for the early response 
      analysis. Other MRI methods, such as quantitative perfusion analysis, MR 
      spectroscopy and texture analysis, are still under study.

AB  - Purpose To determine radiologic and clinical markers predictive of missed 
      injuries at early whole-body CT image interpretation. Materials and Methods For 
      this retrospective study, 2354 consecutive whole-body CT examinations were 
      performed in patients with multiple traumas from 26 hospitals interpreted at a 
      teleradiology center study during on-call period from February 2011 to September 
      2016. All whole-body CT images were interpreted by the on-call radiologist and 
      reviewed within 12-48 hours by another radiologist to detect missed injury as the 
      standard of reference. The first and review reports of all examinations were 
      retrospectively reviewed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression with 
      a stepwise selection method were performed to identify clinical and radiologic 
      predictors of missed injury. Results This study included 639 women (27.1%) and 
      1715 men (72.8%). The median age of men, women, and the entire population was 34 
      years (age range, 1-96 years). On a per-scan basis, there were 304 (12.9%) missed 
      injuries and 59 (2.5%) were clinically significant. On a per-injury basis, the 
      missed injury rate was 530 of 5979 (8.8%). More than two injured body parts (odds 
      ratio, 1.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.8]; P = .01), patient age older than 
      30 years (odds ratio, 2.8 [95% confidence interval: 2.1, 3.8]; P < .001), and an 
      initial clinical severity class of 1 (odds ratio, 1.9 [95% confidence interval: 
      1.3, 2.8]; P < .001) were independent predictive factors of missed injury. 
      Conclusion Multiple traumas with more than two injured body parts, age older than 
      30 years, or an initial clinical severity class of 1 were associated with missed 
      injury at whole-body CT. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available

TI  - Limits of intravascular contrast extravasation on computed tomography scan to 
      define the need for pelvic angioembolization in pelvic blunt trauma: a specific 
      assessment on the risk of false positives.
PG  - 527-535
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000002001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective was to assess the predictive performance of different 
      intravascular contrast extravasation (ICE) characteristics for need for pelvic 
      transarterial embolization (TAE) to determine the risk factors of false 
      positives. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in our trauma center 
      between 2010 and 2015. All severe trauma patients with pelvic fracture were 
      included. Pelvic ICE characteristics on computed tomography (CT) scan were 
      studied: arterial (aSICE), portal surface (pSICE), and extension (exSICE) 
      anatomic relationships. The overall predictive performance of ICE surfaces for 
      pelvic TAE was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. The 
      analysis focused on risk factors for false positives. RESULTS: Among 311 severe 
      trauma patients with pelvic ring fracture (mean age, 42 ± 19 years; mean Injury 
      Severity Score, 27 ± 19), 94 (30%) had at least one pelvic ICE on the initial CT 
      scan. Patients requiring pelvic TAE had significantly larger aSICE and pSICE than 
      others (p = 0.001 and p = 0.035, respectively). The overall ability of ICE 
      surfaces to predict pelvic TAE was modest (aSICE area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.90]; p = 
      0.011) or nonsignificant (pSICE and exSICE). The high-sensitivity threshold was 
      defined as aSICE 20 mm or more. Using this threshold, 76% of patients were false 
      positives. Risk factors for false positives were admission systolic blood 
      pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater (63% vs 20%; p = 0.03) and low transfusion needs 
      (63% vs 10%; p = 0.009), extravasation in contact with complex bone fracture (78% 
      vs 30%; p = 0.008), or the absence of a direct relationship between extravasation 
      and a large retroperitoneal hematoma (100% vs 38%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A 
      significant pelvic ICE during the arterial phase does not guarantee the need for 
      pelvic TAE. Three quarters of patients with aSICE of 20 mm or more did not need 
      pelvic TAE. Several complementary CT scan criteria will help to identify this 
      risk of false positives to determine adequate hemostatic pelvic procedures. LEVEL 
      OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level IV.

TI  - Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation: a specific sign of bowel necrosis in 
      closed-loop small-bowel obstruction.
PG  - 4225-4233
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5402-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify computed tomography (CT) findings associated with bowel 
      necrosis in patients with surgically confirmed strangulating closed-loop 
      small-bowel obstruction (CL-SBO) due to adhesions or internal hernia. METHODS: 
      This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and 
      informed consent was waived. To identify CT signs of bowel necrosis, two 
      gastrointestinal radiologists performed blinded, independent, retrospective 
      reviews of 41 CT studies from consecutive patients who had CL-SBO due to 
      adhesions or internal hernias and who underwent surgery within 48 h. On the basis 
      of surgical and pathological findings, patients were classified as having 
      reversible ischemia or histologically documented necrosis. Univariate statistical 
      analyses were performed to assess associations between CT signs and bowel 
      necrosis. Kappa statistics were computed to assess interobserver agreement. 
      RESULTS: We included 25 (61%) women and 16 (39%) men with a median age of 79 
      years. Bowel necrosis was found in 25/41 (61%) patients and ischemic but viable 
      bowel in 16/41 (39%) patients. Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation was 
      the only CT finding significantly associated with bowel necrosis (p = 0.0002). 
      This sign had 58% (95% CI, 37-78) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 79-100) 
      specificity for necrosis. Interobserver agreement was fair (0.59; 95% CI, 
      0.37-0.82). CONCLUSION: Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation is specific 
      for bowel necrosis and should lead to prompt surgery for bowel resection. KEY 
      POINTS: • Increased unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation is the only sign specific 
      for necrosis • Decreased bowel-wall enhancement is not relevant for 
      differentiating reversible ischemia from necrosis • Preoperative knowledge of 
      bowel necrosis is helpful to plan adequate surgery.

TI  - Acute Jejunoileal Diverticulitis: Multicenter Descriptive Study of 33 Patients.
PG  - 1245-1251
LID - 10.2214/AJR.17.18777 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute jejunoileal diverticulitis is a very rare and potentially 
      serious disease affecting mostly elderly patients. The diagnosis is based on 
      imaging but remains underrecognized. The purpose of this study is to describe the 
      clinical and CT features and the outcomes of patients with acute jejunoileal 
      diverticulitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of acute jejunoileal diverticulitis 
      managed at three French hospitals November 2005 through January 2015 were 
      identified retrospectively. The final diagnosis relied either on a clinical and 
      radiologic data review by a panel of experts or on surgical findings. 
      Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and 18-month outcome data were collected. CT 
      scans were reviewed by two radiologists who reached a consensus about the 
      presence of an inflammatory diverticulum, evidence of complications, and presence 
      of other bowel diverticula. RESULTS: We identified 33 cases of acute jejunoileal 
      diverticulitis in 33 patients with a median age of 78 years, including 30 (91%) 
      patients in whom an inflammatory diverticulum was identified at the jejunum (n = 
      26, 87%) or ileum (n = 4, 13%). Extraintestinal gas was seen in 10 (30%) patients 
      and extraintestinal fluid in 11 (33%) patients. Other small-bowel diverticula 
      were visible in all 33 patients. The diverticulitis was mild and resolved with 
      nonoperative treatment in 22 (67%) patients and was severe in the remaining 11 
      (33%) patients, eight of whom required emergent surgery. CONCLUSION: Acute 
      jejunoileal diverticulitis is a rare and usually nonserious condition that 
      chiefly involves the jejunum. A detailed CT assessment may allow nonoperative 
      treatment.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of CT signs for predicting adnexal torsion in women 
      presenting with an adnexal mass and abdominal pain: A case-control study.
PG  - 75-81
LID - S0720-048X(17)30493-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.11.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine which CT findings or combinations of CT findings could 
      accurately identify adnexal torsion in a cohort of women admitted for abdominal 
      pain and presenting with an adnexal mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local 
      institutional review board approved this retrospective case-control study 
      involving adults-the informed consent requirement was waived. Enhanced computed 
      tomography (CT) findings of 32 consecutive adnexal torsion and 32 control 
      patients admitted for abdominal pain and presenting with an adnexal mass were 
      independently reviewed by two radiologists, with consensus by a third one, for 
      all CT findings commonly assessed in adnexal torsion. All twisted and untwisted 
      adnexa were confirmed by surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were 
      performed for adnexal torsion prediction. RESULTS: The median patient age was 41 
      years (interquartile range, 30.5-62 years). Only benign masses were encountered 
      in the torsion group. Five CT features were significantly associated with adnexal 
      torsion: a large ovary with a threshold at 80mm (p=0.005), median or 
      contralateral displacement of the adnexa (p=0.00014), asymmetric wall thickening 
      of the mass (p<0.0001), inter-utero-ovarian mass (p<0.0001) and whirlpool sign 
      (p=0.0006). In the multivariate analysis, only the inter-utero-ovarian mass was 
      independently associated with adnexal torsion (odds ratio=130 (CI95%: 
      15-infinite), p<0.0001) with an excellent overall diagnostic performance 
      (AUC=0.89; CI95%: 0.81-0.97). It was a sensitive (Se=97%, CI95%: 84-100) and 
      specific feature (Sp=81%, CI95%: 64-93). CONCLUSION: An inter-utero-ovarian mass 
      is an accurate and reliable CT finding for diagnosing adnexal torsion in patients 
      with acute abdominal pain and an adnexal mass.

TI  - Clinical Relevance of the Feces Sign in Small-Bowel Obstruction Due to Adhesions 
      Depends on Its Location.
PG  - 78-84
LID - 10.2214/AJR.17.18126 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate if the feces sign can be 
      used to predict successful nonoperative treatment or progression to ischemia in 
      patients with small-bowel obstruction (SBO) due to adhesions. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: For this single-center retrospective observational study involving a 
      blinded independent review by two radiologists of 237 consecutive CT examinations 
      of 216 patients with SBO due to adhesions (age: mean, 70.9 years; median, 74 
      years; interquartile range, 62-84 years), the location of the transition zone 
      (TZ), number of TZs, and presence and location of the feces sign relative to the 
      TZ were recorded. The reference standard for diagnosing ischemia was surgical and 
      pathologic findings (n = 108 CT examinations) or, when treatment was nonoperative 
      (n = 129 CT examinations), clinical outcome. Factors associated with successful 
      nonoperative treatment and ischemia were identified by univariate and 
      multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A feces sign was seen in 88 of 237 CT 
      examinations (37.1%). The feces sign was at the TZ, which we refer to as the "TZ 
      feces" sign, in 82 of 88 (93.2%) patients; between two TZs, which we refer to as 
      the "trapped feces" sign, in 14 (15.9%) patients; and in both locations in eight 
      (9.1%) patients. By univariate analysis, an isolated TZ feces sign was associated 
      positively with successful nonoperative treatment (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% CI, 
      1.71-6.66; p < 0.001) and negatively with ischemia (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.85; 
      p = 0.02). Combined TZ and trapped feces signs were associated with ischemia (OR, 
      24.16; 95% CI, 2.86-203.89; p = 0.003). By multivariate analysis, regardless of 
      the location of the feces sign, the feces sign was not significantly associated 
      with successful nonoperative treatment or progression to ischemia. CONCLUSION: 
      The feces sign is common and helps to identify the TZ. Among the CT signs of SBO, 
      the feces sign does not independently help to predict successful nonoperative 
      treatment or progression to ischemia.

TI  - How to differentiate acute pelvic inflammatory disease from acute appendicitis ? 
      A decision tree based on CT findings.
PG  - 673-682
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-5032-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To construct a decision tree based on CT findings to differentiate acute 
      pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from acute appendicitis (AA) in women with 
      lower abdominal pain and inflammatory syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board and informed 
      consent was waived. Contrast-enhanced CT studies of 109 women with acute PID and 
      218 age-matched women with AA were retrospectively and independently reviewed by 
      two radiologists to identify CT findings predictive of PID or AA. Surgical and 
      laboratory data were used for the PID and AA reference standard. Appropriate 
      tests were performed to compare PID and AA and a CT decision tree using the 
      classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm was generated. RESULTS: The 
      median patient age was 28 years (interquartile range, 22-39 years). According to 
      the decision tree, an appendiceal diameter ≥ 7 mm was the most discriminating 
      criterion for differentiating acute PID and AA, followed by a left tubal diameter 
      ≥ 10 mm, with a global accuracy of 98.2 % (95 % CI: 96-99.4). CONCLUSION: 
      Appendiceal diameter and left tubal thickening are the most discriminating CT 
      criteria for differentiating acute PID from AA. KEY POINTS: • Appendiceal 
      diameter and marked left tubal thickening allow differentiating PID from AA. • 
      PID should be considered if appendiceal diameter is < 7 mm. • Marked left tubal 
      diameter indicates PID rather than AA when enlarged appendix. • No pathological 
      CT findings were identified in 5 % of PID patients.

TI  - Assessment of Strangulation in Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction on the Basis of 
      Combined CT Findings: Implications for Clinical Care.
PG  - 798-808
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2017162352 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To determine which computed tomography (CT) findings or combinations of 
      findings can help to accurately identify strangulation in adhesive small bowel 
      obstruction (SBO). Materials and Methods Contrast agent-enhanced CT findings in a 
      cohort of 256 patients consecutively admitted for adhesive SBO, with a delay of 
      less than 24 hours between CT and surgery for the operated patients, were 
      reviewed independently by two radiologists, with consensus by a third, to assess 
      CT findings commonly associated with strangulation. The reference standard for 
      strangulation was surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to 
      identify predictors of strangulation in the entire cohort and to identify 
      predictors of the need for surgical resection in the subgroup of patients with 
      strangulation. A CT score was obtained and diagnostic performances of different 
      combined CT findings were calculated. Results In this study, 105 patients (41.0%; 
      105 of 256) underwent a surgical procedure, 62 of whom were found to have 
      strangulation (59.0%; 62 of 105), whereas 151 patients (59.0%; 151 of 256) 
      improved with medical care. Three CT findings were significantly associated with 
      strangulation in the multivariate analysis: reduced bowel wall enhancement (odds 
      ratio, 7.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 23.5), diffuse mesenteric haziness 
      (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% CI: 2.5, 15.2), and a closed-loop mechanism (odds ratio, 
      6.5; 95% CI: 2.8, 15.5). The model combining these three features had an area 
      under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.96) and a high negative predictive value 
      (97%; 95% CI: 93%, 99%). Positive likelihood ratios were high when two or three 
      of these CT findings were combined (positive likelihood ratios, 14.7 [95% CI: 
      7.1, 30.4] and 43.8 (95% CI: 14.2, 135.2], respectively). Among the strangulated 
      cases, reduced bowel wall enhancement (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 12) and 
      mesenteric fluid (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 12.8) were predictive of 
      resection. Conclusion A score that combines three CT findings (reduced bowel wall 
      enhancement, a closed-loop mechanism, and diffuse mesenteric haziness) can 
      accurately predict strangulation in adhesive SBO. (©) RSNA, 2017 Online

AB  - CONTEXT: Prostate cancer stratification is based on tumour size, pretreatment PSA 
      level, and Gleason score, but it remains imperfect. Current research focuses on 
      the discovery and validation of novel prognostic biomarkers to improve the 
      identification of patients at risk of aggressive cancer or of tumour relapse. 
      OBJECTIVE: This systematic review by the Intergroupe Coopérateur Francophone de 
      Recherche en Onco-urologie (ICFuro) analysed new evidence on the analytical 
      validity and clinical validity and utility of six prognostic biomarkers (PHI, 
      4Kscore, MiPS, GPS, Prolaris, Decipher). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: All available data 
      for the six biomarkers published between January 2002 and April 2015 were 
      systematically searched and reviewed. The main endpoints were aggressive prostate 
      cancer prediction, additional value compared to classical prognostic parameters, 
      and clinical benefit for patients with localised prostate cancer. EVIDENCE 
      SYNTHESIS: The preanalytical and analytical validations were heterogeneous for 
      all tests and often not adequate for the molecular signatures. Each biomarker was 
      studied for specific indications (candidates for a first or second biopsy, and 
      potential candidates for active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, or adjuvant 
      treatment) for which the level of evidence (LOE) was variable. PHI and 4Kscore 
      were the biomarkers with the highest LOE for discriminating aggressive and 
      indolent tumours in different indications. CONCLUSIONS: Blood biomarkers (PHI and 
      4Kscore) have the highest LOE for the prediction of more aggressive prostate 
      cancer and could help clinicians to manage patients with localised prostate 
      cancer. The other biomarkers show a potential prognostic value; however, they 
      should be evaluated in additional studies to confirm their clinical validity. 
      PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed studies assessing the value of six prognostic 
      biomarkers for prostate cancer. On the basis of the available evidence, some 
      biomarkers could help in discriminating between aggressive and non-aggressive 
      tumours with an additional value compared to the prognostic parameters currently 
      used by clinicians.
